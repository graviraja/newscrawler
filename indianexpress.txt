U.S. stocks closed 2013 by setting record highs and world equity markets ended at six-year peaks on Tuesday, while benchmark bond yields posted their first annual rise since 2009.Ultra-easy monetary policies and an improving economic outlook worldwide led to a stellar year for stocks.

Gold fell to a six-month low in thin year-end trade on Tuesday, notching up its biggest annual decline in 32 years as prospects for global economic recovery prompted investors to switch to riskier assets.After a 12-year bull run, gold has shed 28 percent in 2013, with the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to step away from ultra-loose monetary policy undermining the investor rationale for holding bullion.Years of accommodative monetary policies had propelled the price of gold to all-time highs of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011, as low interest rates encouraged investors to put money into non-interest-bearing assets.In choppy trade on Tuesday, spot gold fell 1 percent to its lowest since June 28 at $1,184.50 an ounce, before recovering its lost ground. Prices were up 0.38 percent at $1,201.13 per ounce at 2:29 p.m. EDT (1929 GMT).U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled at $1,202.3, down $1.5 an ounce, having earlier fallen to a low of $1,181.40. That was down 28 percent from the end of last year.Bullion was the third-largest loser for the year on the 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB index, after corn and silver."For the first three months of the year at least we are quite pessimistic on gold and a break below $1,180 could trigger further declines to the $1,000 mark," T-Commodity partner Ganclaudio Torlizzi said."Moreover, the dollar should strengthen towards the euro in January, as the economy improves, and that's another bearish element for gold," he added. "For the time being, investors will continue to put their money into equities."World stocks were ending 2013 close to six-year peaks and benchmark bond yields were poised for their first annual rise since 2009 as investors celebrated a pick-up in global growth with expectations of more to come.The dollar was on track to end 2013 modestly higher against a basket of main currencies.... contd.
Four former Congress chief ministers, two serving NCP ministers, a BJP MP's kin and top bureaucrats are under scanner in the Adarsh housing scam. Senior NCP ministers faced the heat over allegations of rampant corruption in irrigation projects. In 2013, Maharashtra struggled to come to grips with cases of corruption and crony capitalism just like several other states.Would 2014 usher in a welcome change? Though cynicism on overcoming the malaise continues to be high, the new year brings some hope in the form of a stronger Lokayukta (LA).The Congress, rattled by the rout in recent Assembly polls in four states, has decided to push the anti-corruption agenda to regain lost ground. After enacting the Lokpal Bill, it has now directed all Congress-ruled states to empower LA institutions. On December 28, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said the Maharashtra LA and the Upa-Lokayukta (ULA) will be strengthened within two months.Sources said the plan was to provide the LA and the ULA with their own prosecution wings. While the final modalities are being worked out, the plan is also to bring senior government functionaries, including ministers, in the LA ambit. It is also proposed to grant powers to attach and seize properties acquired by public servants through illegal means; powers to recommend the transfer and suspension of erring officials, besides power to secure services of state and Central government officials.Former Karnataka Lokayukta Justice (retd) Santosh Hegde said, "While strong LAs in states and Lokpal at the Centre cannot wipe off corruption completely, they can reduce it to a great extent."Though the state was the first to have a LA and a ULA � the legislation in this regard was enacted in 1971 �government functionaries conceded that they have remained mere 'paper tigers' owing to lack of autonomy. "To the best of my knowledge, the Maharashtra LA enjoys no powers at all. It has also not been provided the infrastructure required to be effective," said Hegde.... contd.
Tucked away in Kemps Corner at the Khareghat Colony lies Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum, the city's only community museum dedicated to Parsi artefacts. But over the years, as with most heritage structures in the city, the building has come under disrepair. But 2014 brings great news with it. In a three-phase plan, over five years, the museum will be restored to more than its former glory."The organisers of the 10th World Zoroastrian Congress wanted to leave a lasting legacy on the city, so I asked them to take up the issue of restoring the Alpaiwalla Museum. The structure is fabulous and didn't need much work, but the roof was leaking and the toilets were not usable. That has been changed. Also the museum was last restored 30 years ago, so the display techniques are all old. We want to change it according to current world standards," says Pheroza Godrej, an art conservationist and honorary consultant to the museum. The restoration project is being financed by the Mumbai Parsi Punchayet. The Parsi diaspora has also come forward to donate for its renovation.The museum will be inaugurated today with a small ceremony, although no artefacts will be displayed. Godrej says they'd like to change shows every three to four months. One of the first shows will have a reproduction of the western staircase from the Apadana in Persepolis in a 12-foot-long glass fabrication. The second is a replica of the sanctum sanctorum of an agiary. Both the pieces were made, thanks to the sponsorship of philanthropist Dr Cyrus Poonawala and was shown at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in the UK last year. The first phase is to make sure the structure of the building is fine and to recruit a team to manage the museum's daily functioning. The second phase has two parts � one where the showcases and lighting will be changed and the second where the artefacts will be restored. ... contd.
Camera manufacturers are a worried lot. The improvement in phone cameras have over the past few years eroded almost all of their business in the point and shoot range. Almost everyone clicks pictures these days, but not all are using something that has been built exclusively for the purpose. This is why innovation has become the key to survival in the camera business. Nikon pushed the envelope a bit too far when it launched the D800 with a 36MP sensor, Canon was silent for a while before it thought of the ultra compact 100D. But since then, most of the innovation has happened from Sony, not exactly the first name that comes to your mind when you think of cameras. They launched the stunning RX1, a compact camera with a full-frame sensor, the RX100s that took compact cameras to a whole new level and now the new Sony Alpha a7 and a7R DSLRs, both full-frame mirror-less cameras in very manageable sizes. I put the Sony a7 to the test. Design  The design reminded me a lot of the RX1. In fact, the body is not much larger even though this is a full-frame DSLR. But the RX1, the great camera that it is, would develop a serious complex in front of this one. That is because this has a tiltable LCD panel, a proper eye piece though looking into an electronic OLED viewfinder and whole range of lenses to play with. It is compact, but build like a Colt with a body that will weather most storms, and dust storms, that come its way. All the ports are tucked away behind sturdy flaps. Despite the small built, the camera offers a very steady, DSLR-like, grip. There is a thumb rest near where all the controls are settles. There is a ring here to adjust the settings and another on up front accessible with your fingers. While framing a shot, both these will come in more than handy. There are two customisable buttons that maker life much easier. Plus, you can switch between auto focus and auto exposure lock on the body itself. I would have preferred this to have been a switch for manual focus. ... contd.
The New Year's barely dawned but the social calendar of the city already looks promising.

Big B's next big move � he leads the cast of a fiction show on Sony, directed by Anurag Kashyap, that will go on air this year � will hopefully begin yet another trend. Likely to follow him first is his wife Jaya, who is also said to have joined the cast of another show for the same channel.

"It (LFW) has been consistent in introducing cutting-edge innovations and this is elegantly on display on the runway. This dual approach to creativity is something I can respond to," Singh said in a statement. LFW is scheduled to take place from March 11-15 at the Grand Hyatt, Santa Cruz east.... contd.
Built in 1878, Mumbai's iconic Rajabai Clock Tower is undergoing restoration for the first time in 135 years. Come monsoon this year, the renovated clock tower and the restored Mumbai University (MU) library building it stands on, will be unveiled. Like it did in days gone by, the restored tower will chime a different tune every 15 minutes.The clock tower has an interesting history. It was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott on the lines of the famous Big Ben in London and its cost of Rs 2 lakh was funded by Premchand Roychand, the founding member of the Bombay Stock Exchange. He named it after his mother Rajabai. With failing eyesight, Rajabai could not tell the time, and wished to eat her dinner before the sun set. Roychand, therefore, built her a clock tower that would chime every 15 minutes. For the restoration of the iconic tower, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has donated Rs 4.2 crore to MU, says Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the university, Dr Naresh Chandra. Head of the architectural firm Somaya and Kalappa that has been hired for the job, Brinda Somaya says that working on the restoration of such a beautiful structure is every architect's dream. "The work began post-monsoon last year. We opened up the roof of the tower and began the restoration work. The initial cleaning of the stones and removing the vegetative growth is done. We're reinstalling the fire systems and electrical conduits," she says.Somaya explains that there is an attempt to make the heritage building more disabled-friendly. "We are constantly brainstorming about what we can do to make the building more accessible to everyone. Renovation is not just about cosmetic buildings," she says. The work is going smoothly and should be completed by this monsoon, Somaya says. Apart from the clock tower, the University library building is also being renovated, for which temporary arrangements have been made in another building in the campus.... contd.

Yet another LPG price hike (non-subsidised cooking gas, which customers buy after consuming their quota of subsidised cylinders) has been effected today, with the govt announcing a steep rise of Rs 220 per cylinder on firming international rates.The 14.2-kg LPG gas cylinder that consumers buy beyond their entitled nine bottles at subsidised rates, will now cost Rs 1,241, up from Rs 1,021 in Delhi, state-owned fuel retailers said.This is the third increase in non-subsidised LPG rates in the past month. The price was hiked by Rs 63 a cylinder to Rs 1,017.50 on December 1.

A 22-year-old vegetable vendor was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Tuesday at his residence in Sector 49. While the police claimed that the deceased, Rupinder, had committed suicide, his family is suspecting foul play as he had an affair with his friend's sister, who refused to marry him.Some of Rupinder's neighbours claimed that his hands were tied behind his back when his body was found by his sister-in-law in the morning.

It seems to be a case of suicide. But we have initiated proceedings under section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)".
It may rain jobs in the new year as companies are gearing up to add over 8 lakh new employees to their payrolls and dole out salary hikes of up to 20 per cent to best performers in 2014, say experts.As per estimates of various human resource consultants, the year 2014 seems very promising for job market unlike 2013, when hiring went slow across mid and senior levels and recruitments were done only to replace 'key' gaps.In the new year, the country is likely to witness a huge surge of opportunities for job seekers with more and more corporates investing in their businesses."Yes, 2014 looks bullish on hiring. 2014 will be seen as a good happening year from the jobs perspective as the global economy is improving and India being one of the largest service provider for the global market," leading executive search firm GlobalHunt MD Sunil Goel said.

Apple Inc said it had no "backdoor" in its products after a security researcher and a leaked document suggested the US National Security Agency had unfettered access to the iPhone.Apple said that it "has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone."The statement added that " we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products."Security researcher Jacob Applebaum described the NSA program based on a purportedly leaked document about NSA access to the iPhone, in comments made in Germany. Apple said it "is continuously working to make our products even more secure, and we make it easy for customers to keep their software up to date with the latest advancements... and will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers and defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them."Applebaum told a security conference in Germany that the program called DROPOUTJEEP allowed the NSA to intercept SMS messages, access contact lists, locate a phone using cell tower data, access voice mail or activate an iPhone's microphone and camera.He described it as "an iPhone backdoor" that allowed the NSA to access any iPhone.The documents were also described in the German newspaper Der Spiegel.Security researcher Graham Cluley said in a blog post that Applebaum's presentation and the documents show a "broader range of tools that the NSA apparently deploys against other technology companies and products, including HP (Hewlett-Packard) servers, Cisco firewalls, Huawei routers, and so on."But Cluley said the document "does not mean that the NSA has complete control of your iPhone" because physical access to the device would be needed."It may be that they have since found unpatched vulnerabilities in iOS to install the spyware onto targeted devices remotely... but that's not what the leaked documents say," Cluley said.... contd.

Besides, we also plan to put in place final guidelines for research analysts, for which we have come out with draft norms and all these matters are being actively considered right now," Sinha said in an interview."On insider trading, we have done many things, but still I will say it is something about which there is a perception in the country that Sebi needs to do more."Often, people compare us with the US, without realising that there it is not the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) alone, but most of the high-profile cases in the US have been handled by their criminal justice system," he said.Sebi is currently in the process of overhauling its nearly two decade old insider trading norms, pursuant to which those indulging in unlawful insider trading activities would be dealt with severely.Many new categories of persons, including public servants, regulatory officials, judiciary and government officials dealing with unpublished price-sensitive information are being brought under the purview of insider trading.At the same time, new norms would also seek to clearly differentiate between 'innocent mistakes' and genuine transactions of company executives from the unlawful and serious trading offences.Often, comparisons have been made between regulatory action against insider trading in India and the US, where some high-profile cases including that of former banker Rajat Gupta has come to light in recent months.... contd.
Agent of Change: The City VoterA Mumbaikar has never really been a voting enthusiast. More so, if he has a south Mumbai address. But this year, the birth of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led to a super turnout in the country's political capital. So, will India's financial capital stage a turnaround and drive voters to the polling booths? Or will tedium take over the better of their spirits, like always. For instance, despite a massive public outcry after the 26/11 terror attacks in 2008, the voter turnout in Mumbai remained abysmal at less than 44 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections that followed four months later.With the city accounting for six Lok Sabha seats and 36 of the total 288 Assembly seats in the state, Mumbaikars are naturally sought after voters. And though the city has been notorious for poor voter turnouts, there is optimism among activists and psephologists this time around.Price rise that directly affects the middle-class and the corruption expos�s have prodded voters across the country, especially in urban areas, to come out and vote. "Pockets such as Greater Kailash in New Delhi that always had low turnout suddenly saw 70 per cent people casting their votes - an AAP affect. We can hope something similar in south Mumbai where voters have always shunned elections," says Ajit Ranade, economist with AV Birla group.Ranade's optimism is borne out by official data. In a drive undertaken by the collector over the last 18 months, 6.28 lakh new voters have been registered in suburbs, taking the total number of registered voters to over 73 lakh. Similarly, 1.08 lakh new voters were added to the 26 lakh voters in the island city in the past one year. "The quantum of voter registrations, especially first-time voters, is much higher this time around," says C V Oak, island city collector. Moreover, the deletion of 12 lakh 'extra' names from electoral rolls will also naturally bump up the voter-turnout percentage. ... contd.

The last of the hockey icons, Balbir Singh Sr turned 90 on Tuesday, looking back with satisfaction at his long and rewarding tryst with hockey, which he calls his "first love", but sad at the state of the game in India.Gentle and soft-spoken as ever, ramrod straight Balbir belies his years. Triple gold Olympian and a victorious Olympic captain, he was also the chief coach and manager of the team that won the one and only World Cup hockey title for India in 1975.Chosen as one of the 16 'iconic Olympians' across all disciplines since 1896, the start of the modern Olympic era, Balbir was honoured by the International Olympic Committee during the 2012 London Olympics along with other great sportsmen such as legendary sprinter the late Jesse Owens.Balbir remains the holder of Olympic and world record for the most goals scored by an individual in an Olympic men's hockey final for scoring 5 out of the 6 goals against Holland in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. He captained the Indian team that won the title in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.Despite an outstanding career, Balbir remains a modest man and has to be coaxed into talking about his achievements. 'I was very lucky', he says.He calls hockey 'my Goddess, my first love and my darling'. He is still waiting for his 'hockey fairy' who would help India regain its glory in the game. Asked about the state of Indian hockey, Balbir replies, "Very bad. I did not want to say this word. I feel dejected. I am sad,"He recalled that when he was being honoured during the London Olympics, the Indian team had not won a single match which had shocked him. "Balbir comes and Balbir goes but India is there forever. It is India which is more important". ... contd.
Every year on June 24, in the bustling East Indian village of Irla in Vile Parle (west), an unusual tradition is followed as a commemoration to St John the Baptist.St John, or as the locals call him, Sao Jao, is recognised in the Bible as a preacher with a unique practice of baptism for forgiveness of sins. According to the Christian faith, St John is also the man who baptised Christ in the rivers of Jordan. The East Indians of century-old Vile Parle gaothan, interpret this action a little further."The feast is a much-awaited time of the year. In addition to the religious ceremonies and the feast held in honour of Sao Jao, we have a tradition of jumping in the village's wells. This practice is especially reserved for the newly-weds. After the big feast in their homes, they must dance in a parade around the neighbourhood to the live music of the East Indian bands," said Cheryl D'Souza, a resident of Irla.As the young couples move around the neighbourhood, they are drenched in a shower of water by residents of buildings and houses on the route, who use buckets and pipes to hose them down. The parades end at the four village wells, and as a grand finale, the couples are thrown into the water bodies deliberately. "Even if the person does not know how to swim, they have to jump in the well. A big tyre is tied as a floatation device or a swimming float is brought along, but all must jump. Along with the couples, other members of the community, and whoever wishes to, is welcome to jump in the well. If it is a rainy day, it is double the fun as the whole affair turns into a big rain dance party," said D'Souza.... contd.
Despite outnumbering men in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies, women corporators are an unhappy lot. Reason: they have not been given a free hand in decision-making process. They might have a point, but officials and activists, argue that women corporators are themselves to blame for their plight as many of them o not actively participate in raising public issues inside civic general body meetings or even on public platforms.Following the state government's decision to reserve 50 per cent wards for women, as many as 78 women corporators made it to the 152-member PMC general body in the last elections. In PCMC, 65 women corporators were elected in the house of 128 corporators."Things have hardly changed in local politics as men take a call on all important issues and women corporators have to accept that," said Vaishali Marathe, chairperson of Women and Child Welfare Committee."The civic administration does not take us seriously and it can be made out from the poor attendance in the committee meetings," Marathe said, adding, the members had to take up the issue with the municipal commissioner and threaten to resign if the situation prevailed.PMC Congress corporator and state Congress chief Kamal Vyavhare said that there is not much attention given to the good work done by us. "We need more publicity to highlight our work. The lack of recognition for good work is not encouraging to women who are performing well in politics," she said.However, former Pune mayor Rajlaxmi Bhosale said if a person has the capability then no one can stop them from making their presence felt. "The women corporators have to blame themselves for their situation. Most women corporators are there because the ward has become reserved and male member cannot contest. Thus, they are incapable of taking decision and go by what they are told," she said.... contd.

It may rain jobs in the new year as companies are gearing up to add over 8 lakh new employees to their payrolls and dole out salary hikes of up to 20 per cent to best performers in 2014, say experts.As per estimates of various human resource consultants, the year 2014 seems very promising for job market unlike 2013, when hiring went slow across mid and senior levels and recruitments were done only to replace 'key' gaps.In the new year, the country is likely to witness a huge surge of opportunities for job seekers with more and more corporates investing in their businesses."Yes, 2014 looks bullish on hiring. 2014 will be seen as a good happening year from the jobs perspective as the global economy is improving and India being one of the largest service provider for the global market," leading executive search firm GlobalHunt MD Sunil Goel said. According to industry estimates, over 8.5 lakh new jobs may be created in the calender year 2014. The issuance of new banking licences will be a major contributor, while IT, healthcare, agri-business, infrastructure and education sectors are also likely to witness robust hiring trends."Last calendar year was not good either for job seekers or for employers due to uncertain and fluctuated economical and political conditions. 2014 is coming with positive vibes for jobseekers and expecting to create 8.5 lacs new jobs in different sectors," Rajesh Kumar, CEO, MyHiringClub.com & FlikJobs.com said.With regards to salary, the average hike for most sectors is expected in single digits, while top performers can expect pay rise of around 15-20 per cent in 2014, experts say."This New Year is going to bring cheer for employees with a salary hike of double-digit of at least 10-12 per cent. In 2014, companies are expected to revise the compensation package and explore a more motivational approach," Indian Staffing Federation Vice President Rituparna Chakraborty said.... contd.
Private and mini bus operators' associations in West Bengal Tuesday announced that they will hold a one-day "token" strike on January 6 demanding fare revision."The decision was taken after a meeting of five bus and mini bus operators' associations here during the day", vice-president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, Dipak Sarkar said.The strike call comes a day after state transport minister Madan Mitra ruled out any hike in bus fares."When diesel prices are rising on a regular basis, how can bus fares be controlled?" Sarkar asked.Besides the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, the Minibus operator's Coordination Committee and the All Bengal Bus and Mini Bus Co-ordination Committee, Howrah have also supported the strike call, he said.Private bus operators have been demanding a fare hike to cope with increasing operational costs and a substantial rise in fuel price.Addressing a press conference here yesterday, state transport minister Madan Mitra had said it was not correct on the part of the bus operators to claim that the existing fare structure was not viable."Any hike in bus fares is not on the government's agenda," Mitra had told reporters.
A 16-year-old girl, who was gangraped twice in a day around two months ago at Madhyamgram in North 24-Parganas district of West Bengal and had attempted suicide on December 23, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital here Tuesday. The victim was admitted to the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata with 70 per cent burn injuries after she attempted self-immolation in her house near Dum Dum, where her family had shifted after the rape incidents at Madhyamgram.A gang of men raped the girl on October 25 near her house.

Days ahead of the January 5 general elections in neighbouring Bangladesh, Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami Tuesday reviewed security on the Indo-Bangla border, which would be sealed during the polls and also discussed various issues including BSF's demand for land to set up battalion headquarters and border outposts. Goswami also held a meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and met senior security officials, including those of the state government."We discussed law and order situation of the state among other matters. The state government asked for funds (for different projects) and we told them to send us project reports," Goswamy, who came to Kolkata on a special BSF flight, said after the meeting. He returned to Delhi in the evening.Mamata, however, described it as a routine meeting saying they discussed the border situation. Asked whether Bangladesh elections and the situation there came up for discussions, she said: "Why should I talk about the internal matters of another country?"According to sources the projects for which the state government asked for funds included modernisation and special infrastructure scheme for the state police, border fencing and building up of more coastal police stations, to name a few.State Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee, however, said that 80 per cent of the meeting was devoted to the border with Bangladesh in view of the elections in the neighbouring country."Elections are scheduled to be held (in Bangladesh) on January 5. He (Goswamy) asked for a detailed report about the situation along the border and the steps being taken. The border along Bangladesh is going to be sealed," Banerjee saidAnother issue that came up during the meeting was a surrender package for KLO militants, in the line of the package given by the central government to surrendered Maoists. "One of the state government officials broached the subject and the Union Home Secretary said the Centre would consider it," a top central government official told The Indian Express.... contd.
New Year brings with it new beginnings and optimism. A lot of people like to usher in the New Year with resolutions that they eventually end up breaking. Many of these New Year resolutions revolve around personal finance since financial well being is an important aspect of life. A lot of people usually fail to maintain such New Year financial resolutions because they over complicate their resolutions making them hard to maintain. Before making your resolutions for 2014, the most important thing you should do is to review your current financial status. Here is a quick check for making a simple and achievable New Year resolution for anyone irrespective of earnings and expenditure. Apart from improving the overall financial health, this can help you take smarter financial decisions in the long term.Review your investment portfolio: Reviewing one's investment portfolio by the end of the year is one of the best steps for taking a good investment related resolution. While reviewing the overall investment portfolio, one must ask some basic questions as to how risky the investment portfolio is and explore the adjustments where required. If you are single and have started working only recently, you can afford a riskier portfolio compared to married people with families. One thing that is common while evaluating your personal investment portfolio for the year is to always maintain a balance between long term goals and any emergency requirements for a rainy day.Pay off Debt: Paying off old debt is one of the best ways to usher in the New Year. Budgeting and paying off old debt might not be as difficult as it may appear and only require a principled approach. One can set up accounts to automatically deduct monthly expenses. Get out of the old debt trap to increase the chances of improving your financial health in the coming year. ... contd.
Tata Power Ltd today welcomed Arvind Kejriwal's Delhi Government announcement of providing 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units, saying it was a "good move" which will provide relief to majority of the consumers in the city."It is a good move from the point of view of consumers. It will provide them relief. I welcome the decision by the government," Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (TPDDL) CEO Pravir Sinha said.Delivering on yet another poll promise, the Aam Aadmi government yesterday announced a 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units in Delhi, which will benefit around 28 lakh of the total 35 lakh consumers in the city.When asked about Government's move to order CAG scrutiny of the finances of the three private power distribution companies, Sinha chose not to comment but said TPDDL will comply with the law.He, however, said TPDDL was responding to government's directive of making their stand clear on the CAG scrutiny of the companies."If the law of the land demands that (the CAG audit), we will definitely comply with the directive. We will comply with all the statutory and administrative laws and regulations," Sinha said.TPDDL supplies power to 13 lakh consumers in North and North West parts of Delhi. The other two companies � BSES Yamuna Power Ltd and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd � supply power in rest of the areas in the city except areas under jurisdiction of New Delhi Municipal Corporation.Asked whether Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission will be under pressure not to hike electricity rates even if power purchase cost by distribution companies goes up due to rise in cost of fuel such as coal and gas, Sinha said the regulatory commission is "very independent" and it will take correct decisions.... contd.
A woman was allegedly stabbed and set on fire by a group of men, including a village sarpanch, in Ganjam district of Orissa on Monday evening. She succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday. Pranati Das (30), an owner of a public distribution system (PDS) shop, was at home in Sanaramchandrapur village in Rambha area of Ganjam on Monday when she was called out by two men. When she came out, "five people, including the sarpanch of the Sanaramchandrapur grampanchayat, stabbed her with a sword, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire," Ganjam SP Ashish Kumar Singh said. "She had shut her shop by 7 pm. There was a power-cut in the area and people were in their homes when the incident happened," he said.Das, who lived alone, was taken to MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town with more than 95 per cent burn injuries. As her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to a hospital in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh where she succumbed to her injuries Tuesday morning.The SP said the woman had, in her dying statement, accused the sarpanch of trying to get ownership of her shop. "There clearly was lot of  bad blood between the two. From her house, we recovered a couple of threatening letters from him (the sarpanch), asking her to to give up the dealership of the shop.""It would have been difficult for us to nab the accused had the woman not revealed their names in her dying statement. We have arrested four of the 5 accused. The case would be put up for fast-track trial," he said.
While he can look back and say 2012 was a nightmare, Manan Vohra will end 2013 on a very happy note. Injuries and bad luck had been plaguing the Chandigarh-based opener last year, but when he got his chances this time, he didn't let them go. As he slammed a career-best 187 against Jharkhand in the last league match and gave Punjab a good chance of making it to the knockouts of Ranji Trophy this season, Manan reposed the faith shown in him by the state selectors. Till now, Manan has scored 343 runs in the four matches he has played so far and his batting may have also solved the jigsaw puzzle that was the Punjab opening pair. Manan has had to work hard for the results. A knee injury had kept him out of cricket but he used the off season to work both on his batting as well as physical fitness. He hit back-to-back centuries for Punjab in the C K Nayuddu Under-25 tournament and that was enough for the selectors to usher him into the Ranji XI. In his comeback match against Vidarbha, Manan scored an impressive 52 runs in the second innings. He could have easily made a hundred seeing the confidence in his batting but he got run out. In the next match against Karnataka, while all struggled against the opposition bowlers, Manan stood tall and scored 69 runs in the first innings at Hubli. Although, Punjab lost the match, Manan did leave a mark. But he gave glimpse of his talent when he played a commendable innings of 187 runs against Jharkhand in the first innings, laying a firm platform for Punjab. Jharkhand being 210 for 9 at the end of the second day's play in their first-innings, puts Punjab in a commanding position in the match. ... contd.
Dr Kanu Kalsariya, former BJP MLA from Mahuva, who successfully spearheaded the public agitation against Nirma group's proposed cement plant in Bhavnagar district, is likely to join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Gujarat. Kalsariya who lost the Assembly elections last December which he fought under an independent banner, has been motivated to join the fledgling party after its stunning Delhi win.Following its victory in the capital,  AAP has seen a flurry of registration of members in the state, but Kalsariya joining the party is likely to prove a shot in the arm of the party in Gujarat. He is also likely to bag a key post in AAP, say sources. When contacted on him joining AAP, Kalsariya said, "I am seriously churning the idea of joining AAP along with my supporters. We are considering that on emergency scale and will take a decision in this regard by tomorrow."A general surgeon from Bhavnagar, Kalsariya has been the face of the farmers' agitation in Gujarat which also caused a lot of embarrassment to the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government. It was the farmers' agitation under Kalsariya's leadership that has so far kept the Nirma's cement plant away from Mahuva of Bhavnagar district. Union Government's Ministry of Environment & Forest (MoEF) has revoked the sanction granted to the project and a litigation in this regard is on at National Green Tribunal.Incidentally, Arvind Kejriwal had supported a similar agitation against land acquisition for setting up the Raksha Shakti University in Lavad village of Gandhinagar district in 2012. The villagers were protesting that it was pastoral land. Although Kalsariya had openly revolted against the BJP-ruled Gujarat government by supporting farmers' cause across the state, the BJP did not suspend or dismiss Kalsariya. In fact, in the 2012 Assembly elections, Kalsariya fought elections under the banner of his group called Sadbhavna Manch from Gariadhar constituency of Bhavnagar. He, however, lost badly to a BJP candidate.... contd.

The big screen once used for showing films now stands lifeless. The expanse of the wooden stage lies before it, with workers occasionally walking around to clean the place. Very few, however, are aware that underneath this platform stands a big room with a narrow well at its centre. Before it was converted into a talkie in 1926, Dhobitalao's Edward Theatre used to be a space for staging plays. Although Fred Poonawala, the managing partner of the theatre, says the place dates back to mid-1800s. The exact date of its construction is not known, he adds. It has since retained its original plan and structure, including the orchestra pit, balconies, the two green rooms at the back as well as the room below the stage. Edward Theatre's legacy is well known but few are aware of the room atop which the film screen now sits. "My guess is the room was used as a place where the performers gathered before and after the performance or during the break time," he says, adding that it served the purpose of performers to enter and exit the stage. There is also a contraption, although not currently in operation, which perhaps allowed a performer to rise up to the stage from below. Currently, the room is used by the theatre's staff as a space where they can take a breather. The well, Poonawala adds, must have been used by performers for freshening up. The need for it perhaps arose from the fact that the entertainment space needs to be self-sufficient. "But it was also used as a water catchment by residents of the Dhobitalao area," adds Poonawala who is attempting to revive Edward Theatre's legacy as a space for performing arts. dipti.nagpaul@expressindia.com
For the last century-and-a-half, Mumbaikars have relied on the suburban railway system to efficiently ferry them around the city. Nearly 160 years after the first engine chugged out on a trial run from Bombay to Thane, the efficient but aging and grubby mass transit system will face competition from two sleek new transportation systems that will make their debut in Mumbai in 2014.Driving this change will be 100-plus men and women with an average age of 25 who will be at the helm of these new systems.For those used to seeing bored-looking middle-aged men driving the suburban rail system, the young, smartly dressed drivers of these transportation systems of the Metro and monorail will come as a refreshing surprise.Termed as "Train Captains" and "Metro pilots," men such as 23-year-old Setal Patel and his contemporary Priyanka Balit (23) will be in charge of driving the swanky monorail and the Metro and phenomenally change the way Mumbai looks at travel in 2014."It is an exhilarating feeling that we will be in charge of driving a system that will be used for the first time in Mumbai and completely change the way the city travels," says an excited Balit, who will be one of the first few women drivers running the Metro on its 11.07-km route from Versova to Ghatkopar.Close to 16 trains will be run on the Versova-Andheri stretch for which 63 "Metro Captains" are being trained at various locations, including Versova.Interestingly, the Metro has also opened up new job avenues for hundreds of people from all sections of the society.Balit's father is a driver in the Gulf and the Vikhroli resident says that being a first generation engineer, the new job which places safety of almost 1,500 commuters in her hands, has done a lot to boost her self-confidence.... contd.

Ever wondered what it would be like to touch a starfish or sea cucumber? You can soon touch one in the New Year at the revamped Taraporewala Aquarium. Likely to open by end of March, the new aquarium will have a touch pool, where curious visitors can touch star fish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and turtles. This year, exotic fish from overseas will be introduced at the new aquarium with fisheries officials pegging the number of new varieties of marine fish at 70. You can try and find Nemo in the Maroon Clownfish tank, besides getting to see Azure Damsel, Blueline Demoiselle, Purple Firefish, Cloudy Damsel, Copperband Butterflyfish, Schooling Bannerfish, Raccoon Butterflyfish, White Tail Trigger, Clown Triggerfish and Blue Ribbon Eel. The 40 new varieties of freshwater fish would include Red Devil, Jaguar, Electric Blue Jack Dempsey, Frontosa and Catfish. These fishes will be housed in larger tanks than before with imported flexi glass for better visibility.Moving around the aquarium would literally become a cooler experience in 2014 as the whole structure will be centrally air-conditioned. If you are fatigued, the aquarium now has on offer a fish spa therapy. You can dip your feet in a tub of water filled with small fish called Garra rufa. While there will be 10 tanks of Garra Rufa for the therapy, marine and tropical fish will be housed in 16 tanks each and freshwater fish will be housed in nine tanks. Moreover, each tank will also have a theme specific to the kind of fish it houses. Aquascaping ad LED lighting will bring alive the coral ecosystems as well as the rocky barren ecosystems. A special semi-circular tank has been designed to house the jelly fish.For those more inclined towards learning about fishes and the marine ecosystem, the new aquarium will have a 50-seater theatre screening documentaries on fish, marine ecosystems and environment conservation. ... contd.
Women officers and constables in the city police said they do not feel insecure and they do get  support from their male counterparts . However, they said they do not get challenging assignments compared to their male counterparts. "A woman police officer has to prove her skills and take initiative if she wants to be a part of any special or challenging task. Whereas, there are many male police officers who are chosen for such tasks without their skills being considered," said a senior female police officer.She said, "There have been officers like Meeran Borwankar who have handled top posts like Pune police commissioner. So, even though the number of females in the police department is much less than males, there is enough scope for those with a "go-getter" attitude. Working in police department is a satifying job. And if you show initiative, you are certainly rewarded."In the 8,000-strong city police force, there are nearly 1,500 females, including one ACP, nine police inspectors, 46 assistant inspectors, 73 sub inspectors, 16 assistant sub inspectors and 1,135 constables.ACP Smita Patil, who is heads the Chatuhrshrungi division, is the senior-most female officer in the city police. There is no police station having a female senior inspector. Earlier, senior inspector Sushma Chavan was in-charge of the Cantonment police station. She is now with the cyber crime and economic offences wing (EOW) of city police. Besides, female officers are handling key responsibilities like inspector Smita Jadhav, in-charge of Women's Grievance Redressal Cell, inspector Neelam Jadhav, in-charge of Deccan and Shivajinagar traffic division. Female officers and constables are deployed in all branches and police stations of city.Some of the female officers and constables said they also work on night duties with their male counterparts and there have been no serious problems related to their security and safety. ACP (administration) Abdur Rehman said, "We have a committee to check harassment of female cops at work place. Any female cop can approach and complaint to this panel."... contd.
It takes some time to adjust to the fact that 'he' is an 'it'. Standing on the second floor balcony of Mohammedbhoy Mansion at Kemps Corner, a lone figure, a bare male trunk, a mannequin, has over the years moonlighted as a landmark. That he has now achieved quirk status only makes 'it' special.The occupant in the second floor apartment, French entrepreneur Siddharth G, 34, and his girlfriend spotted it during their walks around Colaba lanes. "There were body parts in half. A store was throwing them away, just like that. So we picked the best parts and assembled it here, on the balcony. It was 2006, it has been here since," he explains.Over the years, Siddharth has developed a way to introduce himself. "In gatherings and parties, when I meet people, I ask them if they know this house by the corner which has a mannequin on its balcony," he says. "So many people have their own stories, they have met beneath my house using the mannequin as a landmark," he laughs.Siddharth, who lives with two cats Mowgli "like in Jungle book" and Nokia "as in the phone", the mannequin is as much a housemate. While one neighbour gushes that "he might have Parsi blood in him", another suspects "the mannequin is mostly to scare the pigeons". Siddharth says it's neither."In France, when we place the national flag outside the window, nobody troubles you. When I came here, I placed a huge Indian flag across the balcony. It was full of Indian colours, bright. The police pulled it down the next morning. Now I have the mannequin," he says.Initially, the expat took him along to all parties. "Being French, I used to arrange parties themed 'An Evening in Paris'. I used to place the mannequin wherever � in the middle or someplace at the party � as my mascot, my identity," he adds. ... contd.
Senior deputy mayor Kashmiri Devi did not spend a single rupee of the Rs 20 lakh allocated to her, while deputy mayor Satish Kainth used only Rs 4.16 lakh of the Rs 10 lakh allocated to him. This was revealed in a report of the municipal corporation. The tenure of the mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor ended on Tuesday, with the allocated funds not being fully utilised. Even Mayor Subhash Chawla utilised only Rs 1.75 crore of the Rs 2 crore from the Mayor Development Fund.Councillors of the opposition rue that no money from the Mayor Development Fund was allocated for work in their wards. They alleged that only Congress councillors benefited from the funds.The senior deputy mayor reportedly never attended office and was out of India for several months during the year. Leader of the opposition in the House, councillor Arun Sood said, "The overall performance, when it comes to spending the funds, is poor. The wards of the opposition councillors were completely neglected. Even when it comes to spending the ward development funds, it is the BJP councillors who take the lead," he said.An amount of Rs 40 lakh is allocated to councillors every year for getting work done in their wards. Sood is the only one to have allocated the entire amount. BJP's candidate for the post of mayor, Rajinder Kaur Rattu, allocated only Rs 6.58 lakh for development in her ward. H C Kalyan, mayoral candidate for the Congress, was fared better as he allocated Rs 15.67 lakh for his ward.Mayor Chawla lists highlights of tenureMayor Subhash Chawla listed out his achievements in the past one year on the last day of his term. He claimed that during his tenure, a new overbridge was inaugurated and the construction of a new multi-level parking lot in Sector 17 started. He also stated that a sewerage treatment plant was inaugurated. Also, efforts were made to take stray cattle out of the city.... contd.
Women have been making their presence felt in the teaching field in Pune for long. According to the District Information System for Education (DISE), as on May 2013, the state of Maharasthra has 2,97,480 female teachers working various educational institutions. This amounts to more than 43 per cent of the total 6,91,038  teachers employed in 1,03,625 schools and junior colleges across the state. In Pune district, more than 60 per cent of total 53,397 teachers are women. As many as 32,427 female teachers have been working in more than 6,849 educational institutes up to higher secondary level, the DISE data reveals. According to education department officials, the number of female teachers in teaching profession has been steady over the past few years with retention rate relatively high compared to other professions. Varsha Sharma, principal of Abhinav English Medium School, Ambegaon, who has been in the profession for over 15 years, said flexible job timings and limited working hours make the profession one of the most sought after jobs by women."Teaching is also a safer profession. Women can go home and be with their families by evening. Besides, it is a noble profession indeed, which shapes young minds and inculcate values and principles in next generation. Being part of this noble work gives you immense job satisfaction," she said.Sharma said issues of women safety associated with other jobs are not present in the teaching profession. "In other jobs, women employees are generally a minority, but in teaching it is not so. For example in our case, we have more than 120 lady employees, including non-teaching staffers in a staff of total around 135. In our secondary education section, 45 teachers are women out of total teaching staff of 50," she said.While the school-level education system has firmly women at its forefront, the same is not true when it comes to higher education sector. In this area, women teachers still face gender bias and are often denied top posts. Educationist Dr A L Deshmukh said most of the female teachers have been facing difficulties in tackling with negative behavioral changes in students. "Today's young generation are more aggressive and have a set of different values influenced by the process of globalisation. Every teacher is finding it difficult to deal with the changes in students and female teachers are especially worried. Certain provisions in the RTE Act have tied up teachers' hands, when it comes to resorting to stringent punishment," he said.... contd.
The stage is set for the mayoral elections scheduled for January 1, with two candidates in the fray for the mayor's post. H C Kalyan of the Congress will be contesting against Rajinder Kaur Rattu of the BJP-SAD for the post which is reserved this year for a Scheduled Caste candidate. It is the nominated councillors who hold the key to the election.Elections will also be held for the post of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. The candidates continued lobbying on Tuesday to garner support for themselves. Apart from votes of councillors of their own party, the candidates are also approaching the BSP and the nominated councillors to ask for votes.The Congress has fielded Sat Prakash Aggarwal as the candidate for the senior deputy mayor's post. Earlier this year, he was in the race for being fielded by the party as the candidate for the mayor's post. Contesting against him will be Heera Negi, the vice-president of BJP and councillor from ward 21.For the post of deputy mayor, Sheela Phool Singh has been fielded by the Congress. She has been the deputy mayor for two years in the last term of the MC. Facing her is Davesh Moudgil, a councillor of the BJP.In the 36-member House, there are 12 councillors of the Congress, 11 of the BJP-SAD, two of BSP and one Independent. The local MP too has one vote. Apart from them, there are nine nominated councillors who have voting rights. There is difference of just one councillor between the Congress and BJP. The end result hinges on the nominated councillors. These councillors have the numbers to tilt the election to either side.The nominated councillors in this term have extended support to the Congress on all issues. In the past two elections, they have also voted for the Congress candidates. At a meeting of the nominated councillors held a few days back, a decision was taken to support the Congress in these elections as well. The majority of the nominated councillors are expected to do so. This would give the Congress an edge over the BJP-SAD.... contd.
While some residents went to clubs and hotels, many preferred to listen to kirtan at mandirs and gurdwaras to welcome the new year. Special prayers were also organised at some religious organisations in the memory of the recent acid attack victim Harpreet Kaur, who succumbed to her injuries on December 27 in a Mumbai hospital.At Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib, a special kirtan darbar was organised in the morning, which continued till noon. Pritpal Singh, president of the gurdwara management committee, said, "We organise kirtan darbars every year and this year our hearts are heavy because of the death of acid attack victim Harpreet, who died a few days ago. Last year we had organised a special prayer meeting for the Delhi gangrape victim. This year too, we will pray for the departed soul.""We will pray that the next year ends on a happy note and heinous crimes against women come to an end," he added.In the coming days, the administration plans to organise a seminar, focusing on women security. Students of Kamla Lohtia college also took out a road rally for women security, while Shaheed Sukhdev Thaper memorial trust urged people to refrain from new year celebrations because of the unfortunate incident of the acid attack.For those willing to party, and spend, clubs and hotels left no stone unturned to attract as many as they could. Dine and dance parties were in hotel Raddisson Blu, where an all-girls band had been brought in to perform at the coffee shop. For Rs 4,999, one could enjoy unlimited food and drinks, apart from the performance of the band. New year parties were also organised at Darbar Hall and Terrace Grill at Park Plaza, where singers from Voice of Punjab had been invited.Fortune Park Klassik also organised a party for food lovers, while dance parties were organised at Sutlej Club, Lodhi Club and Ludhiana Club for their members.
Dr Maya Tulpule still shudders when she recalls her experience as a resident doctor on night duty at a government medical college. "There was a seriously ill patient that I had to treat during the night and I decided to wait in the ladies room. There were tales about how some ward boys used to drink at night on the campus and misbehave. Believe me I was scared as the door did not have a latch. I hope there has been a drastic change in the situation 20 years later," Tulpule, president of the city unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said.Tulpule who set up her own five-bed Sahwaas Hospital at Kothrud preferred to employ women (be it nurses or class IV staff) and ensures that they reach home safely. "In my presidential address that will be circulated to 4,000 IMA member doctors, I have made it a point to refer to the guidelines of the Vishaka committee (against sexual harassment) and directed hospitals/clinics who employ more than 10 workers to set up their internal complaint committee. In 2014, Women's Day in March will be observed in a big way by the IMA," Tulpule said.At the 550-bed Ruby Hall Clinic, one of the largest private hospitals in the city, Code Khatra or Code Yellow, an alert system, has been devised that staffers can utilise in case of any perceived threats. Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic, says that 70 per cent of the staff are women and medical director Dr Sujata Malik who heads the a 'Prevention of Harassment' committee admitted that they often receive complaints.They are not in the nature of molestation. Basically there are complaints based on what has been perceived as undesired or unwanted response from the other person. We have reprimanded the concerned staffers and there is awareness that any kind of harassment will be dealt with. There are 800 nurses out of a staff of 2,500 and care is taken that no single nurse is isolated during duty hours. Dr Manisha Bobade, medical director at Jehangir Hospital, said a grievance committee was set up, which included doctors and medical social workers. It shows that staffers are aware that action will be taken against the errant persons. ... contd.
Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane couldn't stop staring at Sachin Tendulkar like a million others when the little master gave his last speech during his farewell Test at the Wankhede Stadium. Then they reverentially walked up to him and requested for a parting photograph in the dressing room.While emotions ran high, for many it was the end of cricket. Tendulkar not only inspired the Ajinkya-Rohit pair to choose cricket but had given them a reason to love the sport over everything else too. As Tendulkar took a final lap of the Wankhede Stadium, many wondered who would carry the mantle of Mumbai's legendary batsmanship forward. "Who next?" everyone thought on that November afternoon.A month on � though a tad early to say this � two men in their mid-20s are taking giant strides to fill the boots of Tendulkar, donning Indian colours and going about cementing their places in the national team. It surely is a tough task for the youngsters to carry on with the legacy of Mumbai's batting great. However, if their outings in 2013 are any indication, the pair is ensuring that Mumbai doggedness and flair are qualities that get represented with team India.  It is as if the maestro's most prized qualities � stylish strokeplay and fighting determination - were split into two juniors, with Sharma carrying the gene of style and Rahane of substance. One look at 2013 and Rohit certainly looks like he has been on a dream run. Of the 28 ODIs played this year, Rohit averages 52 with 1196 runs. He scored a double (206) in an ODI against Australia (only the third in the world to) and with two hundreds and eight fifties this season, Rohit established himself as an opener in the limited -overs format. A Test debut followed soon after the double and he scored 177 on debut followed by a 111 in Mumbai against West Indies. Under his captaincy, Mumbai Indians clinched their maiden title followed by the Champions League and it was his leadership quality too that came to the fore thereafter.... contd.
With New Year come new hopes and promises. In case of Cooperage football ground, though, it has been a case of renewed hope and the same old promises. This year, the wait shall finally end. After nearly three years of delays and false assurances, Mumbai's only football venue will be operational again, come February.Watching a football match at the Cooperage was more dangerous than delightful. The rickety stands at the traditionally uninspiring venue quivered at every step you took. There was a risk of it falling apart every time someone stood up and cheered for a goal. The hard surface with dry grass sprinkled across the centre circle was a torture on the players' knees and produced poor quality football. Ironically, the lifeless venue continued to remain one of the most sought after addresses to hold wedding receptions. It still is. However, it's gotten slightly better for football as well.The wobbly wooden planks have made way for sturdy steel stands imported from China. The yellow-and-blue patterned bucket seats add colour to the venue, quite literally, and a lush green artificial turf has replaced the natural surface. FIFA had granted $2.5 million (roughly Rs 12 crore) for the refurbishment of the stadium. But the falling rupee and bureaucratic delays have resulted in WIFA overshooting the budget by at least Rs 1 crore.They won't mind that, though. Ever since Cooperage, the home of Mumbai football, went for renovation, the sport died a slow death in the city. With no other playable ground in the city, Mumbai-based clubs had to play their I-League matches in Pune and Kolhapur while the Elite Division league had to be scrapped twice. Mumbai Tigers, a newly-formed club owned by a Dubai-based NRI, pulled out of the I-League despite getting a direct entry because there was nowhere to play in Mumbai. ... contd.
The mood that night was of party and cheer, but 29-year-old Kavita Deepak Javaldip wore a grim expression. With her hands folded across her chest, she scanned every face with determination, looking for signs of trouble, unrest, or cheating. Wearing all black, the muscles in her arms rippled as she asked for the party-goers for their tickets and vouchers. Javaldip, who is one of the few woman bouncers in the city, knows well about the dos and don'ts of her job."I first started as a security guard, you know, because of my personality," she says, sheepishly. A muscular frame at 5 feet, 9 inches, Javaldip has been working as a bouncer with a group called Man Power Corporate Protection since 2007. "One of the first things we are taught is to be able to speak with our eyes. We hardly ever have to use words; people are intimidated by our steady, no-nonsense gaze," she explains. "It is a good job, but the only complaint I have is a universal one � the salary can be a little more," says Javaldip, who got married in 2010 to a colleague, also a bouncer.While Javaldip uses her gaze as the strongest point, Priya Awate has gained her confidence because of sthe rigourous lessons in kick-boxing, karate and the hours spent at the gym. She too, started off as a security guard, and gradually worked her way up as a bouncer. "I mostly work at high-profile events and year-end parties," she says, adding: "This is the busiest time for us." Awate does not shy away from giving a hand to the needy in times of conflict or fights. "Sometimes I see that a husband is beating up his wife on the road. I go and try to stop him � and succeed too," she says with a smile.... contd.
Downpour during the day and the chilly weather on Tuesday dampened the festivities for the residents and forced them to make alternative arrangements at places where outdoor parties had been planned to usher in the New Year.Rain started on Monday night and continued during the day. This brought down the temperature. The people who were ready to don their party hats to bid adieu to the year 2013 in the open had to rearrange their parties and events inside the premises as the rain struck a dampening note. The major crowd-pulling spots on the New Year eve were Elante Mall, Blue Ice, Sector 17, Hotel Mountview, JW Marriot, Score, Sector 8, Hotel Taj and almost all the resto-bars in Sector 26.Ankit Gupta, director, Human Veritgo Lounge, said, "Because of the cold weather, the bookings and parties at the New Year eve were not as per expectations. Secondly, hotel industry considers Tuesdays as Sundays. These factors proved to be a dampener."The Met Department had predicted rainfall till December 31st night but a clear day from January 1, 2014 onwards. The department has predicted heavy fog in the next two-three days while the temperature may also plummet from Wednesday. The city on Monday recorded the lowest minimum temperature for the month of December at 3.4 degrees, which was three degrees below normal. According to the MeT Department, December 30 was the coldest night of the season.Surinder Paul, director, Meteorological Department, said, "From January 1 onwards, there will be no rain, though the days would be cloudy. The temperature would fall in another three days while there are possibilities of heavy fog too. The fog would give way to clear sky later."
Deputy Commissioner - Rajat AggarwalThe song Bach ke rehna re baba...is apt for DC Rajat Aggarwal, who has earned the label of a strict administrator from his subordinates. Aggarwal keeps a hawk's eye on all the work shirkers and forced all late comers to be on time. Though he took charge in the last quarter of 2013, in Ludhiana, he earned the support of senior citizens, especially for his project which spoke about their rights. It sent out a strong message to those who do not take good care of their parents. MC Commissioner - Rahul TewariIdhar chala main udhar chala, jaane kahaan main kidhar chala... must be how Municipal Corporation Commissioner Rahul Tewari felt, before he was finally appointed to his present post. While first he was transferred from the post of Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) to  Amritsar DC, recently there was news of him being appointed the new CA of GLADA. However, finally he was made the MC Commissioner.Police Commissioner - Nirmal Singh DhillonKnown for his cool approach while handling even the tough cases, Commissioner Nirmal Singh Dhillon succeeds in pacifying angry complainants soon. One this he is not happy about is the the traffic congestion in this city as he himself has got stuck in traffic jams a number of times. Therefore, apart from maintaining law and order, he believes that managing the traffic properly will solve more than 50 per cent of the problems in the city.CA GLADA - R K VermaSenior IAS officer R K Verma, who is now Chief Administrator of Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA), can be called an IT buff. During his previous posting as MC Commissioner, Ludhiana, or his present post for that matter, he is always available to media on popular apps and in case he is stuck in a meeting, one can leave questions on his app and there is no doubt that he will not reply. ... contd.
Almost a decade after the city police gunned him down in a round of retaliatory fire, the encounter of Kashyap Dhaka is now being probed by a team of the Special Task Force (STF). The officers, who reconstructed the encounter site near the Narmada canal in Harni on Tuesday, will submit their report to the Gujarat HC. Officers of STF arrived in the city from Ahmedabad on Tuesday and visited the site where the encounter had taken place in August 14, 2004. In August 2004, Dhaka was taken to Harni canal area by police to recover the firearms that he had supposedly hidden there. He was shot dead in the retaliatory fire by police inspector G V Desai and sub-inspector D D Damor. CN Rajput, Investigating officer, who visited the Harni Canal area, said, "We are investigating the encounter as per the court directions. " Dhaka was brought to Vadodara on August 9, 2004 on a transfer warrant from Jodhpur police, where he was arrested for vehicle thefts. 
A day after seven shops in the congested Mangal Bazar were gutted in fire, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is awaiting a report from the Fire Department to plan the decongestion of the market area. On Monday, a fire started in one of the plastic shops in the market which spread through seven shops along the line and took about 13 fire tenders to douse the flames. Vadodara Municipal Commissioner Manish Bharadwaj said that the decision on the market area will be taken after the probe report reaches the VMC. "We have found that the shops had all legal documents and permissions to run their business. But it is absolutely essential to rethink about the market area as it could have been worse if the fire had occurred in one of the interior lanes or in the night with no one to spot it immediately. We will certainly give a thought to bringing in measures to prevent such tragedies once the report reaches us in a couple of days."The fire probe has been handed over to the police, which is now awaiting the report from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to ascertain the cause of fire. An officer from the city police station said, "The FSL team has collected samples from the fire site and will submit its findings after which action will be taken against anyone whose negligence may have caused the fire." Officials admit that fire in the shops that make the narrow lanes of the market would be difficult to douse. Chief Fire officer Hitesh Taparia said, "There are narrow lanes in all market areas in India and abroad. It is not practical to think that market lanes will be 12-feet wide roads. What should be our best plan is to mitigate the risk and minimise the problem."
The state government will soon undertake a census of the Great Indian Bustard, one of the most critically endangered flying bird species in the world, to ascertain its exact population. "The count of the Great Indian Bustard will be undertaken in January-February to know its population," Gujarat Principal Chief Wildlife Conservator of Forest C N Pandey said on Tuesday.Pandey said that it is expected to give a realistic picture of the dwindling population of the species. The survey count will be undertaken by the state forest department, various scientific organisations, NGOs and nature clubs. 
BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's next stop for his Vijay Shakhnad rally � scheduled for January 13 � is Muslim-dominated Bareilly where workers are busy hunting for a sprawling ground. The BJP state unit has crossed out Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan where Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav held his rally on November 21 for reason that the party is expecting a "crowd of more than five lakh".BJP national general secretary and UP in-charge Amit Shah, after finalising the schedule for Modi's upcoming rallies, however, did confirm that the party has decided upon Smriti Upwan as the venue for the January 13 rally. "The Ambedkar maidan is smaller than Smriti Upwan. As we are expecting a crowd of more than five lakh, the venue has been changed to Smriti Upwan, spread over 80 acres," a party leader said. Modi will next hold a rally in Gorakhpur, the date for which will be decided today, followed by a rally in Meerut on February 1. According to Shah, a mega state-level rally has been planned for Lucknow in March. Bareilly has five Lok Sabha and 26 Assembly constituencies. Of these, the BJP managed to win two seats � Pilibhit and Aonla � in 2009 general elections and five seats in 2012 Assembly elections. The western UP belt is crucial for BJP as the party sends five of its 10 MPs and 20 of its total 47 MLAs from this region. Also, with Jats comprising a major chunk, the party is expecting a strong polarisation of the community votes to work in its favour in the backdrop of Muzaffarnagar riots. Earlier, Shah held a meeting with the state office-bearers and reviewed the progress of fund collection, which has been going on for the past several months. Sources said the programme to create a corpus fund of Rs 50 crore for the organisation's routine expenditure, has been extended till March 31.  
Gold fell to a six-month low in thin year-end trade on Tuesday, notching up its biggest annual decline in 32 years as prospects for global economic recovery prompted investors to switch to riskier assets.After a 12-year bull run, gold has shed 28 percent in 2013, with the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to step away from ultra-loose monetary policy undermining the investor rationale for holding bullion.Years of accommodative monetary policies had propelled the price of gold to all-time highs of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011, as low interest rates encouraged investors to put money into non-interest-bearing assets.In choppy trade on Tuesday, spot gold fell 1 percent to its lowest since June 28 at $1,184.50 an ounce, before recovering its lost ground. Prices were up 0.38 percent at $1,201.13 per ounce at 2:29 p.m. EDT (1929 GMT).U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled at $1,202.3, down $1.5 an ounce, having earlier fallen to a low of $1,181.40. That was down 28 percent from the end of last year.Bullion was the third-largest loser for the year on the 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB index, after corn and silver."For the first three months of the year at least we are quite pessimistic on gold and a break below $1,180 could trigger further declines to the $1,000 mark," T-Commodity partner Ganclaudio Torlizzi said."Moreover, the dollar should strengthen towards the euro in January, as the economy improves, and that's another bearish element for gold," he added. "For the time being, investors will continue to put their money into equities."World stocks were ending 2013 close to six-year peaks and benchmark bond yields were poised for their first annual rise since 2009 as investors celebrated a pick-up in global growth with expectations of more to come.The dollar was on track to end 2013 modestly higher against a basket of main currencies.... contd.
The Jalpaiguri blast that killed six people last week could have been averted had the West Bengal Police acted on intelligence inputs it received from the central and state agencies.As per the sources in the police, the department had received three intelligence inputs a week ahead of the December 26 blast, alerting the security forces about a platoon of Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) commanders entering the Jalpaiguri town and hatching a terror plot. However, the security forces sat on the inputs. The intelligence inputs suggested that senior KLO leaders were present in Malda and Jalpaiguri to execute terror activities. The outfit, which was not taken seriously by the Bengal Police in last few years, is now said to have  considerable fire power. The cartridges, recovered from a spot in Malda where more than 10 rounds were fired at a public bus recently, belong to sophisticated assault rifle of a senior KLO leader, said a senior official of the state forensic department. "We have information that Malkhan Singh alias Madhab Mondal � a military chief in the KLO � was present at the spot when the shots were fired. The assault rifle belongs to him. However, he has now left the region," said a senior police official.Meanwhile, the police arrested one more person in connection with the bicycle bomb blast.Superintendent of Police Amit P Javalgi said Dipankar Singh, a KLO linkman, was picked up from Kharibari area of neighbouring Darjeeling district, taking the total number of arrests in this connection to three.Earlier, general secretary of Kamtapur People's Party (KPP) central committee, Nubas Burman, was arrested on December 29 from his home at Toofanganj in Cooch Behar while another man, Chandan Roy was arrested from Moynaguri in Jalpaiguri in connection with the December 26 blast. KPP is the political offshoot of the KLO. ... contd.
Consensus seems to have been achieved regarding the pro-tem speaker with both the Congress and the Aam Admi Party (AAP) settling on the candidature of Congress leader Mateen Ahmed. But on the eve of the new Assembly session, the Congress kept the AAP guessing on support for its Speaker candidate, M S Dhir of Jangpura.Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung had appointed senior BJP leader and Janakpuri MLA Jagdish Mukhi as pro-tem Speaker of the Delhi Assembly on Monday. But late Monday, leader of the BJP legislative party Harsh Vardhan conveyed to the Lt-Governor that the party had declined Mukhi's nomination. By Tuesday, JD(U) MLA Shoaib Iqbal � whose name had also been suggested � also said a polite no.The ensuing drama ended when the Congress proposed the name of Congress MLA of Seelampur Mateen Ahmed as pro-tem Speaker. "The DPCC chief Arvinder Singh Lovely contacted Mateen Ahmed for the post of pro-tem speaker of the Delhi Assembly and it has been decided that he will be the pro-tem speaker," Shakeel Ahmed, AICC general secretary-in-charge of Delhi, said.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced to the media outside his house that even though the BJP and the Congress have been quiet about their strategy with regard to their choice of candidate for the post of Speaker, their party's candidate would be MS Dhir.But both the Congress and the BJP continued to remain reticent about their choice of Speaker. Senior Congress leaders said the decision regarding whether or not to support M S Dhir hasn't been taken yet. Harsh Vardhan told Newsline, "We have not yet decided whether or not we will fight the election for the Speaker or not."Sources in the Congress said even though the party is not officially endorsing Dhir's candidature, it is likely to and its reticence in declaring support is part of its policy to keep 'AAP in line'. ... contd.
With rising prices taking centrestage in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections, one of the promises made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in its manifesto was that it would take steps to control the escalating prices of essentialcommodities. With the AAP taking charge on Saturday, the party said it plans to discuss the issue of rising prices in mohalla sabhas in the coming months.According to the AAP, it was necessary to deliberate on such issues with the 'aam aadmi' so that they are aware of why they are paying a certain price for such commodities and what can be done to control the prices.When asked if the issue of price rise would be taken up in mohalla sabhas, Pankaj Gupta, member of AAP's political affairs committee, said, "Yes, why not? We have to put facts in front of the public so that they understand the reasons behind the pricing of commodities and the reason behind price rise. The idea is to provide all the facts to people so that there can be a discussion... The response we get from the mohalla sabhas will help us make our policy decisions related to pricing.""This will also help expose monopolies, if any. Now, there are a lot of companies which are earning huge profits because they sell goods at inflated rates. This needs to be checked. At present, such facts are not available in the public domain," an AAP member said.The manifesto of the party states: "Today, prices of all things are increasing, like onions, tomatoes, water, power or the school fees of children... For the common man, the issue of price rise is related to essential commodities required by them... The complete solution of price rise cannot be found without changing the policies of the central government but the state government can take some steps to improve the situation..."... contd.
Education Minister Manish Sisodia has welcomed the new nursery guidelines, saying it will help make the current education system transparent. Calling them "forward-looking and progressive", the minister said the new guidelines will go a long way in "putting necessary pressure on private schools to keep the admission procedure clean and transparent"."The new guidelines are quite progressive and forward-looking. We view it as a step in the right direction, one that will put pressure on schools to keep their admission process clean. However, a lot more needs to be done and we are committed to doing that," Sisodia said.He especially hailed the scrapping of management quota, saying that the move would help end the culture of donation prevalent in city's private schools. On his plans of making nursery admissions transparent, he said his agenda was to make the process "parent-friendly"."We will ask private schools to make a chart and post it online on their websites. We will ask them to identify the radius of their geographical area of six to eight kilometres accurately, put the fee details and the number of students in every class clearly on the websites so that parents should be able to compare," he had said, in an earlier interaction with Newsline.The decision on nursery admission criteria was taken byLt-Governor Najeeb Jung at the insistence of the High Court. The decision has not found favour with private schools, which are now thinking of challenging the L-G's order in the High Court.But before approaching the court, school authorities are now planning to approach Sisodia and Kejriwal to "present their side of the story" in the next couple of days."The government has only heard one side of the story so far. We would like to go and meet both the education minister and the new CM to apprise them about the interests of private schools. We would like to inform them about the demerits of the guidelines, and how it harms private schools' interests," S K Bhattacharya, chairman, action committee of Private Unaided Recognised Schools, said.... contd.
The Home Ministry has okayed a request for 200 more vans and 3,000 personnel for the police control room unit of the Delhi Police.The Delhi Police had sought more vans and personnel for its PCR unit. It had told the ministry that its PCR unit, the first responder to crimes in the capital, was understaffed. The PCR unit, for several months now, had been requesting the ministry to increase its strength to improve efficiency.A police officer said the department needs more vans and personnel so that the jurisdiction limit of each PCR van can be reduced, bringing down the response time of the police and increasing their efficiency. The additional personnel and vans will be added to the PCR fleet by the end of this financial year."The PCR unit is understaffed and needs 5,400 additional personnel. We need at least nine personnel per PCR van to work in three shifts. Since we are understaffed and have a fleet size that is inadequate, the jurisdiction limit of each PCR van is quite large now, which means PCR personnel take more time to reach a crime spot. Besides, more PCR vans will ensure more visibility of police on the streets and will act as a deterrent for criminals," a senior police officer said.At present, Delhi Police has 800 vans and 8,500 personnel in its PCR unit. Sources said at a meeting held recently in the Home Ministry, it was decided that a total of 3,000 additional personnel will be sanctioned and 200 more vans will be added to the existing fleet, bringing the total number of vans in the unit to 1,000.An additional 2,400 personnel will be added to the police control room unit by 2015.

With the Lok Sabha polls just five months away, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to fast-forward its candidate-selection process. Following a meeting of the AAP's political affairs committee (PAC) within two weeks, the party will announce the names and the number of Lok Sabha seats in which the AAP will field candidates, party leaders said."There is not enough time to follow the candidate selection procedure as laid down by the party during the Delhi Assembly elections. We don't have time to go through several rounds of screening like we did for the Delhi elections � we won't be putting the list of shortlisted names on the website. In less than 15 days, a meeting of the political affairs committee will be held on the issue," senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said.Elaborating on the nature of the candidate-selection process for Lok Sabha polls, Singh said, "There are two ways in which we are deciding candidates for the Lok Sabha polls. People are approaching us � either downloading the form from our website or visiting our district and state-level offices to submit their applications."Moreover, the AAP has also constituted committees to identify prospective candidates for the upcoming general elections in the country. Singh emphasised that only such candidates who stand by the party's values and beliefs will be considered by the PAC.While the AAP is expected to field candidates in at least 22 states, states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Northeast states might not see AAP faces in the Lok Sabha polls."Some states have a strong party presence while others like Jammu & Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal do not have a strong party unit. We are strengthening the existing state units," Singh said.He also said that the party will focus on Lok Sabha seats in urban areas. "We will concentrate on urban areas but reserved seats will also be contested," Singh said.... contd.
A notification to do away with use of red beacons by officials or ministers in the Delhi government is likely to be issued in a day or two. This was one of the first announcements made by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after he joined office."The required approval for this has been received from the L-G's office and a notification will be issued by the Transport department in this regard in a day or two. Only police vehicles, fire tenders, ambulances etc will be allowed to use red beacons thereafter. Red beacons have been removed from most government vehicles soon after the announcement," an official said.The Supreme Court had, in fact, in a recent judgement slammed the blatant misuse of red beacons and had directed the government to revise their usage.Besides doing away with the red beacons, other measures announced by the AAP to do away with the 'VIP culture' included doing away with personal security officers provided to officials. None of the Cabinet ministers have taken government vehicles or bungalows also. Kejriwal himself has refused to take up a sprawling bungalow at Lutyens zone and a guesthouse near Rajghat is being considered for his new residence.While Minister of SC/ST and Employment Girish Soni said he was planning to drive to work on his own, Minister for Women and Child Development Rakhi Birla was seen coming to the Secretariat in an auto-rickshaw on Monday.The AAP government has been moving fast towards fulfilling its promises made in its manifesto. The AAP has already provided 700 litres of free water daily to each household and, on Tuesday, announced the reduction of power tariff in the city.
It was an unusually quiet protest. Around 500 people gathered at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday evening, held a candle light vigil, while communicating to each other their thoughts on the disability rights Bill. There were people in wheelchairs, people who cannot hear and those who cannot speak. But that did not lead to an unenthusiastic protest. Excited hand gestures and facial expressions could be seen in every direction."We are protesting against the fact that even after the approval by the Cabinet of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill on December 12, the Bill wasn't even tabled in Parliament before the Houses got adjourned," Javed Abidi, the convenor of the Disabled Rights Group, an advocacy group for the rights of physically challenged people, said. "Four years went into drafting that Bill. We are scared that the government does not give this Bill any priority and given upcoming general elections, Parliament may not be re-convened early next year for any legislative business. If this happens, then all our effort since the past four years will go down the drain."Abidi, in a wheelchair, could be seen going around the gathering accepting wishes for the new year as well as instructing a few people about the steps to be taken next. Communicating to a hearing- and speech-impaired person, he wrote on a piece of paper: "Arun Jaitley, 11.30 am." Then he outlined a house with his hands indicating that the meeting was to take place in Jaitley's house on Wednesday. He then told him that he should remember to take an interpreter along. "We met the Vice President yesterday. He has promised us unequivocal support. So has Prakash Karat, who we have met before," he said.Sanjeev Malhotra, a 48-year-old government official also in a wheelchair, was watching from a distance. "I have come here to express my support to the cause, but this is not enough," he says. "They have to be more vocal about it. They have to take this beyond a mere emotional display at Jantar Mantar." ... contd.
A day after vowing to fight corruption at a function held at Jantar Mantar, the Congress promised to embark on a 'jan andolan' if the AAP fails to keep its promises within the next two months."The Congress is not in a hurry. We have given them 60 days to come true on their promises. But if everyone in Delhi doesn't receive the promised 700 litres of free, potable water, then we will take to the streets and embark upon a massive jan andolan," former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma said.The Congress also said the AAP through its promises regarding water had cheated the people of Delhi.Sharma alleged that the move would not benefit those living in unauthorised and resettlement colonies, villages and group housing societies."Only those with working meters will benefit from this move. Those in group housing societies and unauthorised colonies and those living in DDA, NDMC and Cantonment areas will not benefit from this move," Sharma said.On Tuesday, the Congress claimed that the AAP's announcement regarding the supply of free potable water was essentially achieved through "mischievous manipulation of statistics".Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said the AAP's policy on water was 'hardly different' from that followed by the Congress during its tenure.Speaking to Newsline, Dikshit said, "The AAP's policy on water is hardly very different from the existing one. It's important to study what exactly it is that they have changed."On being asked whether or not the new policy would strain the DJB, she said this was now the responsibility of Kejriwal and was something he'd have to figure it out."The decision taken by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would only benefit 15%-20% water consumers and those who really need free drinking water, would not get the promised 700 litres of water," Sharma said.... contd.

Centre StageThe curtains will rise on the 16th Bharat Rang Mahotsav on January 4 with a play that has all the trappings of a classic. Directed by Kerala-based KN Panikkar, Chhaya Shakuntalam will be enacted by the National School of Drama Repertory Company, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary. The play is a retelling of Kalidasa's Abhijnana Shakuntalam. Shakuntala represents the green world of nature and Dushyant, a hunter who shoots down a deer. The play highlights the hunt for a prey as well as the quest of a desirous mind.On a Classical NoteUstad Shahid Parvez Khan, one of the most skilled sitar players, takes the stage to commemorate the 75th year of Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan of the famous Rampur Sahaswan gharana. With a specialisation in khayal, thumri and bhajans, Sadiq Khan regaled the audiences for more than six decades. This year will also feature the soulful brilliance of Ustad Rashid Khan (below pic) at Aadi Anant, a festival organised by Mumbai's NCPA. The concert will be held at FICCI auditorium on January 12. Besides renowned greats who will be performing, keep a watch out for upcoming artistes. US-based Alam Khan, sarod player and the youngest son of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan will embark upon his India tour. His concerts might have music connoisseurs sit in judgement; comparisons will be inevitable. Another concert to look forward to will be by Pakistan-based dhrupad singer Aliya Rasheed. A blind musician and a student of famous dhrupadiyas, the Gundecha Brothers, Rasheed is also the only female Pakistani dhrupad singer. Dhrupad, a genre that emerged from the Vedas has many references to Indian mythology and religion, for which Rasheed has earned quite a bit of flak in Pakistan. We look forward to her favourite Ganesh vandana at India Habitat Centre this January.... contd.
The Sports Ministry has cleared with cost the four Indians who have qualified for the Winter Olympics to be held in the Russian city of Sochi in February even though they are not participating in the quadrennial event under the national flag.Due to the suspension of the IOA from Olympic fold, the four Indians � Shiva Keshavan, Nadeem Iqbal, Hira Lal and Himanshu Thakur � are taking part in the February 7-23 Winter Olympics as Independent Athletes under the banner of the IOC."I have approached the Sports Ministry, which said that there would not be any issue on the participation of the four athletes.

In what seemed like an effort to distance himself from the Congress party on the eve of the new Assembly session, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday called his minority AAP government a "48-hour" government. Kejriwal's remarks came in response to a query on whether his government was anxious about the confidence motion on the floor of the House on January 2. "It is not we who are fearful, I am only letting you know what I have been hearing. We do not know politics, we are the 'aam aadmi'. We are hearing rumours from the BJP and the Congress camps. For 48 hours, we will serve the 'janta'," Kejriwal said. But even as the chief minister called his government a short-term one, his Cabinet ministers went about their work as usual. Education Minister Manish Sisodia attended a function at a government school and later held a long meeting with senior officials while Transport Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had a meeting with the secretary. Women and Child Welfare Minister Rakhi Birla went about visiting various shelters for the homeless. SC/ST and Employment Minister Girish Soni met his officials, while  Law Minister Somnath Bharti kept the law secretary on his toes, demanding files and information on how the system works. In a major move indicating change in government stance on important legal issues, the AAP government has decided to change its entire team of law officers. Maintaining that the department is in ICU, Law Minister Somnath Bharti on Tuesday said the lawyers who have been induced in the panel on political recommendations would be shown the door. In a meeting with the law secretary, Bharti reviewed the process of appointment of public prosecutors on Delhi government panel in criminal and civil class. Bharti also called the secretary to access litigation budget in which he found discrepancies. "There are no exact budget reports on how much our standing counsels are paid and what their performance level is. I have been briefed about the quality of the standing counsels that we have and the department will go for a major restructuring," Bharti said. ... contd.
Around 4,000 doctors across Maharashtra will go on an indefinite strike from Thursday in protest against the alleged assault on a resident doctor in Solapur's Civil hospital by three policemen on Tuesday morning. The strike will directly affect work in all public hospitals of the state.The strike was called after Dr Prashant Patil was thrashed by three local police personnel following an altercation. The policemen apparently asked Dr Patil to immediately attend to a pregnant lady who they had brought in, even as he was helping another patient with a CT scan test.Medical Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president Dr Santosh Wakchaure said since Patil was from a surgical ward, he requested them to visit the gynecology ward for delivery. "When he told them that he does not have the expertise to help in delivery and that he was already busy with another patient, they started beating him up," Wakchaure alleged."We want the policemen to be suspended since this is a breach of Medical Personnel and Medical Caregivers Protection Act, 2008. One cannot just assault a doctor and go scott free," added Wakchaure. While an FIR has been filed, MARD said the protest will not be called off until action is taken against the three policemen.Solapur's Civil hospital's dean Dr Ashok Shinde said: "While the protest will hamper our work, we cannot do anything about it." He said the doctors wanted to know why one of them was assaulted for no fault of his.The protest will impact hospitals across the state as MARD has around 4,000 doctors attached to it, half of them in Mumbai alone. The state has around 10,000 government doctors in all. Sion hospital dean Dr Avinash Supe admitted that routine work and the out patient department will be affected if the strike continues for long. "For emergency cases, our senior doctors and professors will be available. But they can only tackle a handful of cases. Patients coming to the OPD or for general health issues might face a problem," Supe said.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has directed its public sector units to distribute blankets in the northern region of the country, including in the riot relief camps of Muzaffarnagar, which are reeling under severe cold."5,000 blankets are being sent to the riot relief camps of Muzaffarnagar," Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma said in a statement.He has given directions to the ministry's Public Sector Undertakings for distribution of blankets for the poor and old people in the northern region due to severe winter spell in this part of the country.Snowfall in the hilly areas of northern India has kept the region in the grip of the winter chill. On December 30, Delhi recorded the lowest minimum temperature in a decade for the month of December as mercury dipped to a chilling 2.4 degrees.A high-level official panel had stated that 4,783 displaced people were still living in relief camps for riot-hit victims in Muzaffarnagar where at least 34 children below 12 years had died allegedly due to cold waves. 
The Aam Aadmi Party's government on Tuesday announced that it would be issuing 15,000 autorickshaw permits to those belonging to the SC/ST and OBC categories. Of the 45,000 new permits allowed to be issued by the Supreme Court, only a few permits have been allotted under this category till date. "The government is committed to the cause of autorickshaw drivers and the SC/ST community. The idea is to provide self employment to them. At present, most of the autorickshaws are under the control of a cartel and the drivers employed by them have to pay the owners exorbitant rents. This move of providing permits to the SC/ST and OBC category will help break this nexus,'' Transport Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said.According to the transport department, only 1,300 permits have been issued to drivers under this category even though there is a provision to issue nearly 14,000 permits under the category.Bhardwaj had earlier said 5,500 autorickshaws will be given inter-state permits. These 5,500 autorickshaws are part of 7,000 autorickshaws in the NCR cluster scheme, which is under litigation. While 5,500 individual permits will be issued soon, around 1,500 auto permits will be kept aside till the case is settled, Bhardwaj said.When questioned on how he would clamp down on the autorickshaw cartel, Bhardwaj said the number of autorickshaws plying on the road would have to be increased."We need to add more autorickshaws in a phased manner keeping in mind parameters such as traffic congestion and pollution,'' he said. There are 55,000 autorickshaws plying in Delhi at present and another 45,000 were allowed to be given permits by the Supreme Court.Incidentally, the Delhi government had gone to court six months ago with the proposal of allowing more autorickshaws but it was put on hold by the Supreme Court, which said the state must fill up the OBC/SC/ST quota before seeking more autorickshaws.
He parks his two-wheeler wherever he wishes. Rules like stopping when the signal turns red, driving within speed limits or wearing a helmet mean nothing to him. Whenever he is stopped by a traffic policeman, he gladly accepts the challan receipt, pockets it and zooms off, only to break another set of traffic rules.The rider, in a span of four months, has committed 144 violations � a record of all the violations is stored in the e-challan system. But the violator remains untraceable as he has a temporary registration number plate, police said.Four months after an e-challan machine, which keeps a record of all offenders, was put to use, the data collected by the Delhi Traffic Police shows that motorists in Delhi are habitual offenders. According to data, 1,968 motorists are repeat offenders. Of them, 150 drivers have repeated an offence more than eight times."The top three violators � the two-wheeler owner with 144 violations, another with 85 violations and the third with 59 violations � have temporary registration numbers. Among car drivers, the top offender has 17 challans against him," Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Shukla said.According to police, one of the reasons to put in place the e-challan machine was to catch repeat offenders. "Earlier, we had no record of habitual offenders... Now, we have but we do not have the power to cancel the driving licences of these violators. The power lies with the Transport authorities. All we can do is issue challans," a senior traffic officer said.The traffic police is now planning to send a list of the top 50 offenders to the Transport department, so that their licences can be cancelled.Along with this, police may also write to insurance companies, requesting them to increase the premium paid by the offenders. "These offenders will be classified as 'risky drivers' and we are planning to write to the insurance companies and the Transport department in this regard. The matter needs to be dealt with a heavy hand," a police officer said.
There was heavy security in the capital on New Year's Eve. Several points in the city were barricaded and armed policemen were seen manning the barricades, checking each and every vehicle passing on the road. Earlier in the day, the Police Commissioner had asked senior officers to patrol their respective districts and ranges. All personnel at the police stations were ordered to report for duty and conduct stringent checks in their areas. At least 1,600 police personnel were posted in Connaught Place on Tuesday evening. There were a total of 51 police pickets in and around the Connaught Place area. Police sources said there were around 15 check posts in the New Delhi district, with most in front of hotels and bars. Heavy security was also deployed at India Gate and in some parts of South Delhi. Police sources said senior officers of the rank of Deputy Commissioners of Police and Joint Commissioners of Police were ordered to patrol various roads till 2.30 am. Entry to Connaught Place had been banned for all after 10 pm, except those who have their offices and hotel bookings.  Door-frame metal detectors were also installed at the entrances to Connaught Place.The traffic police were also posted in full strength, conducting stringent checks for drink driving. The traffic police chief, Special Commissioner Taj Hasan, said a meeting had been held with bar owners urging them to raise awareness about drink driving. Hasan said traffic police would be coordinating with local police in various areas to stop drink driving. Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deepak Mishra said, "We appeal to the people to celebrate the New Year peacefully. We have provided enough security on the streets of the city tonight. Safety of women is our prime concern. Our officials will be on the roads to help anyone in need. I request people to immediately call the police control room, if they spot any suspicious activity."
India on Wednesday cancelled the Rs 3,600-crore VVIP chopper deal with Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland in view of bribery allegations.Below are the list of stories reported by the Indian Express that prompted Defence Ministry to investigate the alleged kickbacks in the VVIP helicopter deal. 1. EX-IAF CHIEF BRIBED: Italian investigators Tuesday alleged that business conglomerate Finmeccanica bribed S P Tyagi when he was chief of the Indian Air Force to swing the controversial AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal in favour of the company. VVIP chopper deal probe: Ex-IAF Chief Tyagi was bribed to swing deal by Manu Pubby2. CONTRACT TWEAKED BY INDIA: In the first corroboration of the findings of the Italian probe into corruption allegations in the VVIP helicopter deal of 2010, it has emerged that critical technical requirements in the contract were tweaked by India, allowing Italian manufacturer AgustaWestland to enter the bidding competition.Records confirm tender was altered, allowing AgustaWestland to qualify by Manu Pubby3. MEA TAKES NOTE OF IRREGULARITIES: Stressing that India has taken "serious note" of the alleged irregularities in the VVIP helicopters deal being reported by The Indian Express, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Thursday said it had called in the Italian ambassador and impressed upon him that the information New Delhi has sought from Rome about the probe there is important.India pressures Italy for info on AgustaWestland investigation by Shobhojit Roy4. ANATOMY OF DEAL: While in the past investigation reports discussed the cast of characters and how money was to be paid for favours, the latest report filed in Italian courts is more significant as it details the money trail. The report specifically talks about how a major part of the alleged Euro 51 million kickbacks was arranged and received by players in Italy, India and Switzerland.... contd.
Unimpressed by the government's decision to cancel the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal over allegations that kickbacks were paid, the BJP Wednesday suggested the move was an attempt to shield people close to the establishment who it said had received bribes.It demanded the government come clean on the identities of 'AP' and 'FAM' who are accused of being bribed by a key middleman in the deal."This is a decision in desperation because serious suspicion was being raised about the involvement of people in the ruling establishment. We want to know what does 'AP' and the family, who are tipped to have got the money, mean," BJP deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said. "This question has not been answered yet. It is a rearguard action."�BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said the UPA government could not hope to shield itself by cancelling the deal."This government cannot shield itself by cancelling the deal because we know that this is a government by scam, for scam and of scam. We want to know who is AP and who is the family who have received large amounts," Javadekar said.�As reported by The Indian Express last month, Italian prosecutors produced in court a "budget" drawn up by two middlemen which purportedly lists initials of Indian politicians and designations of bureaucrats and IAF officers who allegedly had to be "handled" to fix the deal.The document is a note Swiss businessman Guido Haschke claimed he wrote during a meeting with British middleman Christian Michel in 2008.�Under the heading "POL" - Haschke has explained in court this referred to Indian politicians - there is a reference to "AP" against which "3 million euro" has been listed.�The other is "FAM" - explained by Italian investigators in other documents as "Family" - against which "15/16 million euro" has been listed. It is not clear if Haschke has explained in court what "AP" and "FAM" refer to.�... contd.
Rejecting the contention of private power distributors, the Delhi government on Wednesday ordered a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit of their finances, fulfilling yet another election promise of the Aam Aadmi Party."We have ordered an audit of the private power distribution companies. The CAG has said it will do the audit," Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet which took the decision on the audit.He said the Lt Governor's order on the audit of the companies will go to the CAG on Thursday. "From tomorrow, the audit will begin," he said.The Delhi Government had given time to the three companies -- BSES Yamuna Power Ltd, BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd -- till this morning to give their views on why there should not be a CAG audit of their companies.Asked what the companies have told the government, Kejriwal said they had given numerous reasons but not one reason why the audit should not be done."Nobody has given any reason why there should not be an audit," he said adding the auditing will cover from the days the power distribution was privatised.He also rejected the view that the matter was subjudiced and the decision cannot be taken. "The matter has been in the High Court and proceedings are on. No stay has been granted. Even now the proceedings can go on."On complaints about the defective quality of power meters, the Chief Minister said the government would approach IIT Delhi and Delhi College of Engineering for suggestion to improve the quality of meters.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi will address a rally here on January 12 which will set the tone for the party's campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls. Modi's rally on the outskirts of Panaji next week is expected to be attended by over a lakh people.Party president Rajnath Singh will also be present for the rally.State Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, who heads the organising committee for the public rally, told reporters on Wednesday said this would be the only rally to be addressed by Modi in Goa in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls.BJP has already informally announced the candidature of sitting MP Sripad Naik from North Goa seat and its state general secretary Narendra Sawaikar for South Goa.Parrikar said the formal announcement of candidates would be done only after party's parliamentary board clears the names.The Chief Minister said the party leaders will be visiting households to invite people for the rally, while he himself will tour 16 constituencies.The party will collect Rs five each from those attending the rally.

Actor Leonardo DiCaprio says his co-star in 'Titanic', Kate Winslet, is one of the greatest and most genuine person he has ever come across.The 39-year-old actor said he made a lifelong friend while filming the blockbuster, reported Contactmusic."She's the greatest person.

Falling in love can trigger a warm, pleasurable feeling all over the body while being anxious may be felt as pain in the chest, according to a new Finnish study which found common emotions trigger strong bodily sensations.Researchers from Aalto University in Finland studied how emotions are experienced in the body.They found that the most common emotions trigger strong bodily sensations, and the bodily maps of these sensations were topographically different for different emotions.However, the sensation patterns were consistent across different West European and East Asian cultures, highlighting that emotions and their corresponding bodily sensation patterns have a biological basis."Emotions adjust not only our mental, but also our bodily states. This way they prepare us to react swiftly to the dangers, but also to the opportunities such as pleasurable social interactions present in the environment," said assistant professor Lauri Nummenmaa from Aalto University."Awareness of the corresponding bodily changes may subsequently trigger the conscious emotional sensations, such as the feeling of happiness," Nummenmaa said."The findings have major implications for our understanding of the functions of emotions and their bodily basis. On the other hand, the results help us to understand different emotional disorders and provide novel tools for their diagnosis," Nummenmaa said.The research was carried out on over 700 individuals from Finland, Sweden and Taiwan. The researchers induced different emotional states in their Finnish and Taiwanese participants.Subsequently the participants were shown with pictures of human bodies on a computer, and asked to colour the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing."Most basic emotions were associated with sensations of elevated activity in the upper chest area, likely corresponding to changes in breathing and heart rate," the researchers said in Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences.Sensations in the head area were shared across all emotions, reflecting probably both physiological changes in the facial area (ie, facial musculature activation, skin temperature, lacrimation) as well as the felt changes in the contents of mind triggered by the emotional events, they said.... contd.
A new democratic experimentalism is in the air.India's great churning will continue in the coming year. There is new momentum towards change. The momentum will be most manifest in glimpses of a new institutional order that is coming into being. India's progressive moment is now beginning to find its feet, with a clamour for a governance architecture that is more horizontal, transparent, decentralised, based on public reason and allows for new political formations to emerge. This process will continue. The flotsam of the old order will continue to be visible, and will often disguise the new undercurrents forming. More poison may come out of the system as partisan competition intensifies. But amid all the high-decibel exchanges, a quiet revolution will continue. But the revolution will be most palpable in a subtle reorientation of attitudes. The most besetting sin of Indian democracy over the last couple of years has been its corrosive cynicism. It was a cynical democracy with much to be cynical about. But the cynicism had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Few believed anything could change, so little changed. There were no texts, there were only subtexts. Virtue was nothing but deception. We converted it into such an art form that there was cynicism about everything that pretended to be anything other than cynicism. The cynicism was compounded by what Amartya Sen has made India's badge of self-identification: the argumentative Indian. We thought arguing was generally a good thing, since it denoted a kind of freedom and engagement with learning. But we forgot the other side. An argumentative person is someone who goes on arguing, well after the matter has been settled. Much of our public argument had this character. It was not argument in the interest of learning; it was argument in the interest of going on and on. Few who came to the argument were open to being persuaded, few were open to any possibilities other than what they had already committed to.... contd.

To add to the tragedy over the death of a minor gangrape victim  in Kolkata on New Year's Eve, political parties having been fighting among themselves to claim the body for political advantage. Despite the father's repeated appeals to all political parties to stay away from them, as the family had no political affiliations, leaders of some parties tried to get hold of the body to hold protests in the city. Ignoring resistance from the family, the Kolkata Police shifted the body to the Nimtala crematorium. However, early on Wednesday morning, CITU workers snatched the body from the police and took it to their office. Even as some rights activists expressed outrage over the incident, leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress dismissed the episode as a "conspiracy" against the government.While it was widely believed that the victim tried to set herself ablaze, it has come to light now that the 16-year-old girl in her final statement told the police that she was set on fire by her assailants. The police have now lodged a complaint of murder and gangrape against the arrested suspects in the case. The family members of the victim originally hail from Samastipur in Bihar and had settled in Madhyamgram of North 24 Paragana to get their children educated. It is learnt that the second gang rape of the girl happened after she dared to lodge a police complaint about the first attack on her. Following constant threats from the accused, the family left Madhyamgram and settled at Dum Dum in the outskirts of Kolkata a couple of months ago.

Exploiting a spin-friendly track, Saurashish Lahiri wreaked havoc with a career-bestseven-wicket haul as Bengal sealed a spot in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals after a gap of six years, courtesy their narrow four-run win over formidable Tamil Nadu, here today.Needing 185 to win, Tamil Nadu, starting the day at 102 for one, were shot out for 180 as Bengal got six points from the match to take their tally to 24 from eight games.With Baroda on the verge of losing their match against Saurashtra, having conceded first innings lead, Bengal have ensured their passage to the last-eight stage.The victory comes as a major boost as it came on a pitch that was virtually kept under-prepared by the host association in order to ensure a smooth passage into knock-out.In the end, the move by Tamil Nadu coach WV Raman backfired badly as veteran Lahiri ripped through the middle-order today."We didn't have Manoj Tiwary (injured), Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami (on national duty) yet we have beaten two domestic heavyweights like UP and Tamil Nadu in two matches. I tell youngsters like Writtick (Chatterjee), Abhimanyu (Easwaran), Gitimoy (Basu) that more than runs, what we needed is big heart. They showed that they have a big heart," Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla told PTI from Chennai.Veteran off-spinner Lahiri with match-figures of 10/95 was the wrecker-in chief as he removed Dinesh Karthik (62), S Badrinath (21), Baba Indrajith (2) to set alarm bells ringing TN camp."It's not my best performance as I consider my five-for against Karnataka at Mysore on a flat deck some seven seasons back as my best effort. Here I was getting help from the track. But yes, this is the most special win of my 15-year domestic career," an ecstatic Lahiri said."Winning against a Tamil Nadu side with players like DK (Dinesh Karthik) and Badri is a big achievement. In fact the turning point was when I trapped Badri leg before. This is a season where I have re-discovered myself. It has been my best season for Bengal as an all-rounder," said Lahiri, who has 242 wickets and close to 2300 runs in first-class cricket.... contd.
Part-time offspinner Gurkeerat Singh and left-arm tweaker Rajwinder Singh finished with match-haul of eight wickets each as Punjab progressed into the knockout round by hammering Jharkhand by an innings and 173 runs in a Ranji Trophy Group A match here today.The result meant that Jharkhand will have to return to Group C after just one season.Off-spinner Gurkeerat took four for 59, while Rajwinder (3/38) and Rahul Sharma (3/15) picked three wickets apiece to skittle Jharkhand for 127 in their second innings at the Railway Stadium.Punjab bowlers took just 34.1 overs to bowl the hosts after they were asked to follow on Punjab skipper Mandeep Singh on day three here.Resuming the day on 210 for 9, Jharkhand could add only six runs to end their first innings 300 run behind Punjab's total of 516.Left-arm spinner Rajwinder added one more wicket to his overnight tally of four, bringing up his second five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.Asked to bat again, Jharkhand failed to negotiate the spin trio of Gurkeerat, Rajwinder and Rahul.Opener Rameez Nemat, who made 81 in the first innings, was the only batsman to resist once again as wickets kept tumbling at the other end.Nemat made 48 off 85 balls, including seven fours.Gurkeerat finished with match figures of eight for 99, while Rajwinder spent 106 runs to claim his eight scalps.Brief Scores:Punjab: 516Jharkhand: 216 & 127 allout 34.1 overs (Rameez Nemat 48, Kumar Deobrat 24; Gurkeerat Singh 4/59)Points: Punjab 7, Jharkhand 0.

'Anna Karenina' star Keira Knightley has revealed that she once secretly joined Twitter using a pseudonym only to delete the account 12 hours later.The 28-year-old actress says Twitter made her feel a little bit like being in a school playground and not being popular and standing on the sidelines, reported Ace Showbiz. "It made me feel a little bit like being in a school playground and not being popular and standing on the sidelines kind of going, 'Argh'," Knightley said."No, I think that's fine. I like being private. I haven't asked a lot of the actresses who I really admire, 'How do you do it?' because I don't want to know.

It is inevitable that the latest call-up to the Indian ODI squad, Stuart Binny would face additional scrutiny for being the son of selector Roger Binny. However, at least on the day he made the cut for the New Zealand tour, Binny Junior, gave enough and more testament to his ability with a game-changing knock albeit in a different format. Coming into bat with his side both stuck in first gear on a tricky Feroze Shah Kotla pitch and precariously placed at 73/4 after 35 overs, Binny resurrected the innings, hitting six sixes and seven boundaries in a 94-ball 88. Binny would be dismissed with Karnataka two runs short of Delhi's first innings total 202, but his side eventually took the first innings lead and at stumps were comfortably placed at  226/5.While Binny's knock essentially pulled the rug from under Delhi's feet. The hosts needed to win the game to have any chance of progressing to the knock outs, were hamstrung from the start of the day.  Poor visibility delayed the start for close to two hours and it stayed bad enough for umpires to force spinner Varun Sood and military medium Rajat Bhatia to bowl first, instead of Ashish Nehra and Sumit Narwal, who would have been best-placed to take advantage of overcast conditions. Bhatia though delivered for Delhi by bowling opener Mayank Agarwal in his first over. Eventually the light improved enough for Nehra to be introduced, and the pacer got R Samarth pulling to Sood at square leg. The pitch wasn't giving much turn but had no pace on it either, forcing batsmen to generate all the power. In addition the ball was keeping low and through two such deliveries, Varun Sood got last match's centurion Manish Pandey and Abrar Kazi out LBW. ... contd.

The number of mobile Internet users in India seems all set for explosive growth with a report by Internet & Mobile Association Of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International predicting that there will be 155 million people accessing the web through their phones by the end of March 2014. With a quarter-over-quarter growth of 20 per cent, this number is expected to cross 185 million by June 2014, says the 'Mobile Internet In India 2013' report released Wednesday. According to the report, in October 2013, India had 110 million mobile internet users, with just 25 million in rural India. Urban India's dominance of this segment is expected to continue for at least a couple of quarters. Indicating that many Indian's were accessing the internet for the first time on mobile devices, the report says across both urban and rural India over half the Internet users where on the mobile.One of the reasons for this increase in mobile Internet penetration is the fact that the average cost per user had fallen to Rs 387 from Rs 460 in 2012, even though the actual per cent of data costs in mobile bills has gone up slightly from 43 to 45 per cent over the past year. The other reason is the falling costs of Internet enabled smart devices. In fact, a I-Cube Mobile Internet survey conducted in 35 cities in 2013 puts the median cost of web-enabled mobile phone at Rs 7,000 with 52 per cent of Mobile Internet users owning devices priced between Rs 6,501 and Rs 14,000.
A group of volunteers from different parts of Assam have made an innovation of sorts by designing an Assamese word processor similar to the Microsoft Word with a spell checker and word suggestions to boot. Named Jahnabi, the word processor has came as a boon for those who need help in writing the language and can be easily used by those with a rudimentary knowledge of Assamese."The website www.jahnabi.org has received more than 60,000 hits and the free-of-cost software downloaded by more than 1,000 people since it was launched online on November 25 last," says Mridul Kumar Sharmah, one of the members of the team.The Unicode compliant software with a size of 7 mega bytes has at present nearly 2.5 lakh Assamese words and 108 readymade Assamese phrases in its dictionary and counting."The programming of the processor is based on dotnet platform and C# language containing around 15,000 lines of code," Utpal Phukon, the only programmer in the Jahnabi team, said.It took almost 25 days to complete the beta version of the software and the final software was designed in four months, he said.The software contains automatic suggestions for words. Just type the alphabet K and all the words beginning with Ka would appear like Kalam and Kamal. There are also 600 Assamese idioms. The user has the option to create a shortcut for frequently used idioms. There is also a facility to add words to the user's dictionary."If one types the alphabets K and M, words like Kamal and Kamtapur would be listed. All one has to do is click on the word which is required from the list. This makes it easy for people who do not have an in-depth knowledge of the language," Sharmah said. "The main aim to develop the processor is to popularise the Assamese language through Internet and social networking sites as most of the people in the state have rudimentary knowledge of the language due to reasons best known to them," Sharmah said.... contd.

The New Year began with fresh trouble within the ruling Congress in Andhra Pradesh following change in portfolio of a minister from Telangana, triggering strong protests from his cabinet colleagues from the region.While ministers of AP Cabinet hailing from Telangana cried foul over late last night's decision of Chief Minister N  Kiran Kumar Reddy, he shot back asserting that allocation of portfolios to ministers was his sole prerogative.At a time when the party was vertically split along Telangana and Seemaandhra lines, Civil Supplies Minister D Sridhar Babu was divested of the additional portfolio of Legislative Affairs and, in lieu, given charge of the Commercial Taxes Department.The Legislative Affairs charge was given to S Sailajanath, as an addition to the School Education portfolio he has been holding. Sridhar Babu belongs to Telangana and Sailajanath to Seemaandhra.Ironically, Sridhar Babu was one of the most trusted lieutenants of the Chief Minister ever since they worked together as government whip and chief whip respectively between 2004 and 2009 when Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was the CM."Change in portfolio of the minister was purely for administrative convenience and that's my prerogative. Revenue from commercial taxes saw a sharp decline and we wanted to boost it up. So, the minister was given charge of the crucial department," the Chief Minister told reporters in an informal chat at his camp office.  Commercial taxes contributed 26 per cent to the state revenues two years ago but fell to 15 per cent last year and further to 9.5 per cent this year, he pointed out.Interestingly, the CM himself had been holding charge of the Commercial Taxes Department for the past three years. Sridhar Babu, on the other hand, was said to have offered to quit the Cabinet in protest against the "insult to people of Telangana" but his colleagues dissuaded him from taking any hasty step. ... contd.
New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson scored the quickest century ever in international cricket on Wednesday, taking just 36 balls against West Indies to break the record long held by Pakistan's Shahid Afridi.Afridi scored a 37-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in 1996 and had remained the fastest across all formats of the international game since.Anderson, 23, brought up the mark with his 12th six of the innings after the third one-day international in Queenstown was reduced to a 21-over match due to rain.Fastest ODI 100sBalls36 C Anderson 201437 S Afridi 199644 M Boucher 200645 B Lara 199945 S Afridi 200546 J Ryder 2014#NZvWINew Zealand captain Brendon McCullum (33 off 11 balls) started the onslaught before Jesse Ryder (104), who completed his hundred in 46 balls, and Anderson added 191 runs for the fourth wicket."It's one of those things you don't plan on doing when you go out there but obviously with it (being) a reduced game it makes it easier to go harder at it earlier and Brendon showed his intent early on and Jesse played an unbelievable innings as well," Anderson said in a televised interview."I think we went pretty good together. I was hitting boundaries and he was hitting boundaries. It was just one of those things that comes off."I think me and Jesse were thinking every ball was going to get us out or go for six so it was nice to have that feeling out there and get them out of the middle."Anderson remained unbeaten on 131 off 47 balls with 14 sixes and half a dozen fours to take New Zealand to a mammoth 283 for four wickets in their innings.Asked if he was aware of the record, the left-hander said: "No. I didn't have a clue actually. It's not like I look it up and take it down but I guess it's nice to have that."
Every year, kids with big forehands and bigger ambitions, are subjected to a plethora of voices. Some voices are from within, others they can do without. The players who find success at an early age, few in number, are usually the ones that managed to weed out the wrong from the right.Yuki Bhambri was one of those few.In 2009, at just 17, he was the Australian Open boys' singles champion � a junior Grand Slam champion, just like Bernard Tomic had been in the previous year in Melbourne and Grigor Dimitrov had been in the previous year in New York.But while Tomic and Dimitrov soon found their calling as professionals with career high rankings in the low 20s, the voices had caught up with Bhambri.When Dimitrov and Tomic boasted of reaching the third round and quarterfinals of the French and Wimbledon respectively, Bhambri � who is yet to make the main draw of a Slam � played hard to make the second round of the Chennai Open. Before this week began, he had gotten there once in six attempts.The critics sharpened their vocal cords. Some blamed his game. Few wagged fingers at his fitness. Others faulted the facilities around him. By August this year, his ranking fell to a low of 593. All this, while his first round opponent at the 2014 Chennai Open, 22-year old Pablo Carreno Busta, moved astonishingly from a ranking of 700 something to 64th in the last 12 months.On Tuesday, Bhambri and Busta, boys who had crossed each other in opposite directions on the ladder, met. Dealing with those sniggering voices must not have been easy, but the Indian stepped it up on Chennai's show court to bridge the gap.A straight sets win (6-4, 6-3) in the first round of an ATP 250 event may not be much, but for Bhambri it was one step taken on a long and arduous journey ahead. At Nungambakkam on New Year's eve, Bhambri showed that he had the game and the tenacity to walk the remainder of that journey, with a strong and clinical performance.... contd.
Retired Formula One champion Michael Schumacher's condition was stable overnight, but the brain injury he suffered during a skiing accident in the French Alps is still critical, his manager said Wednesday.Sabine Kehm told reporters that his condition has not changed since doctors said he showed small signs of improvement on Tuesday.Schumacher, who turns 45 on Friday, suffered critical head injuries when he fell and struck a rock while skiing. He has since undergone two brain operations and remains in a medically induced coma.''The good news for today is ... there's no significant changes,'' Kehm told reporters gathered outside the Grenoble hospital where he is being treated. ''However, it is still very early, and the situation overall is critical,'' she added.Doctors have refused to give a prognosis for Schumacher, saying they are focused on his immediate care. They are trying to reduce swelling in his brain by keeping him in a coma and lowering his body temperature to between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius (93.2 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit).Kehm said Schumacher was surrounded by his family and that there is always somebody with him.Schumacher is the most successful F1 driver in history, racking up a record 91 race wins. He retired from Formula One last year after garnering an unmatched seven world titles.His accident has drawn immense media attention, and Kehm confirmed Wednesday that earlier in the week security at the hospital stopped a journalist who was posing as a priest from approaching Schumacher.Schumi, as his fans affectionately call him, was famously aggressive on the track and no less intense off-hours. In retirement, he remained an avid skier, skydiver and horseback rider
Putting to rest all speculations, it was today confirmed that star wrestlers Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt will compete in 74kg and 65kg categories respectively at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games to avoid face-off against each other.However, in the FILA competitions, including the world and the continental championships, they will compete in 70kg and 65kg categories.Two-time Olympic champion Sushil and London Games bronze medallist Yogeshwar, who were competing in the 66kg and 60kg freestyle respectively before FILA's announcement to rejig weight classes, have conveyed their decision to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) after a series of discussions with the national coaches.As a result of their decision, Sushil and Yogeshwar will be seen competing in the 70kg and 65kg in the Colorado Springs tournament which will mark their return to the international arena since the 2012 London Games.This will be the first time post FILA's announcement that the two star grapplers will compete in the higher weight categories in the Dave Schultz Memorial International tournament from January 30 to February 1 in the USA."Sushil has decided to compete in 70kg for the FILA competitions while for Olympic qualifiers, Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, he has decided to move to 74kg to avoid any face-off against Yogeshwar. His childhood buddy Yogeshwar has also decided to move to 65kg from his traditional 60kg for Olympic events and FILA championships," chief national coach Vinod Kumar told PTI."The decision was arrived at after a series of talks with both the wrestlers. It was a tough decision but was taken keeping in mind the interest of our nation," he added.Sushil has struggled every time he had to reduce his weight to compete in 66kg. Yogeshwar has won his Olympic medal in the 60kg category in 2012 while Sushil competed in 66kg for his historic silver at the London Games.... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
Exploiting a spin-friendly track, Saurashish Lahiri wreaked havoc with a career-bestseven-wicket haul as Bengal sealed a spot in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals after a gap of six years, courtesy their narrow four-run win over formidable Tamil Nadu, here today.Needing 185 to win, Tamil Nadu, starting the day at 102 for one, were shot out for 180 as Bengal got six points from the match to take their tally to 24 from eight games.With Baroda on the verge of losing their match against Saurashtra, having conceded first innings lead, Bengal have ensured their passage to the last-eight stage.The victory comes as a major boost as it came on a pitch that was virtually kept under-prepared by the host association in order to ensure a smooth passage into knock-out.In the end, the move by Tamil Nadu coach WV Raman backfired badly as veteran Lahiri ripped through the middle-order today."We didn't have Manoj Tiwary (injured), Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami (on national duty) yet we have beaten two domestic heavyweights like UP and Tamil Nadu in two matches. I tell youngsters like Writtick (Chatterjee), Abhimanyu (Easwaran), Gitimoy (Basu) that more than runs, what we needed is big heart. They showed that they have a big heart," Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla told PTI from Chennai.Veteran off-spinner Lahiri with match-figures of 10/95 was the wrecker-in chief as he removed Dinesh Karthik (62), S Badrinath (21), Baba Indrajith (2) to set alarm bells ringing TN camp."It's not my best performance as I consider my five-for against Karnataka at Mysore on a flat deck some seven seasons back as my best effort. Here I was getting help from the track. But yes, this is the most special win of my 15-year domestic career," an ecstatic Lahiri said."Winning against a Tamil Nadu side with players like DK (Dinesh Karthik) and Badri is a big achievement. In fact the turning point was when I trapped Badri leg before. This is a season where I have re-discovered myself. It has been my best season for Bengal as an all-rounder," said Lahiri, who has 242 wickets and close to 2300 runs in first-class cricket.... contd.
In the end the 4 did push out the incumbent 3, after all if had been there for 365 days. As predicted by us, the Google doodle for December 31 did transform to reveal 2014. The animated number are now on celebrating the New Year, complete with blaring speakers and a disco ball. Google's New Year's Eve doodle will transform. You can bet on itEven last year, Google had marked the last day of 2012 with a doodle that finally morphed into another the next day. So while December 31, 2012 was marked by a doodle of people partying hard, January 1, 2013 showed the same scene almost empty with just the cleaners around. This has been a recurring theme with Google's doodles every New Year's Eve since 2011. It is always the same doodle that transforms into another to mark the transition of the year. Before that, there was no tradition of having a special doodle on December 31, though the new year was always marked with one. 
Tata Power Ltd today welcomed Arvind Kejriwal's Delhi Government announcement of providing 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units, saying it was a "good move" which will provide relief to majority of the consumers in the city."It is a good move from the point of view of consumers. It will provide them relief. I welcome the decision by the government," Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (TPDDL) CEO Pravir Sinha said.Delivering on yet another poll promise, the Aam Aadmi government yesterday announced a 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units in Delhi, which will benefit around 28 lakh of the total 35 lakh consumers in the city.When asked about Government's move to order CAG scrutiny of the finances of the three private power distribution companies, Sinha chose not to comment but said TPDDL will comply with the law.He, however, said TPDDL was responding to government's directive of making their stand clear on the CAG scrutiny of the companies."If the law of the land demands that (the CAG audit), we will definitely comply with the directive. We will comply with all the statutory and administrative laws and regulations," Sinha said.TPDDL supplies power to 13 lakh consumers in North and North West parts of Delhi. The other two companies � BSES Yamuna Power Ltd and BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd � supply power in rest of the areas in the city except areas under jurisdiction of New Delhi Municipal Corporation.Asked whether Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission will be under pressure not to hike electricity rates even if power purchase cost by distribution companies goes up due to rise in cost of fuel such as coal and gas, Sinha said the regulatory commission is "very independent" and it will take correct decisions.... contd.
Syed Ata HusnainOn India-Pakistan, the good news is that the armies are talking.It is good to see the trust reposed in the director-general of military operations (DGMO) to stabilise, if not resolve, a tricky military-to-military relationship, which more often than not transforms into a tricky nation-to-nation relationship. But what do such meetings really achieve, and how should they be handled? This time around, it's been all about the Line of Control (LoC) and the frequent flare-ups which threaten to trigger greater tension with Pakistan.The DGMO meeting is not a flag meeting. Flag meetings are at the level of local commanders or staff. They take place on either side of the LoC or border, as the case may be. They are not part of the political dialogue but are just border conferences to temporarily dilute a military standoff in a situation where political parleys are not possible. Unlike a political dialogue, it does not take much effort to organise a flag meeting. Sometimes, they can be held for a specific purpose, not linked to the LoC or to border tension. However, the usual flag meetings at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and LoC are held to de-escalate a crisis situation. A flag meeting between general officers is rare � it remains pegged at the level of colonel or brigadier to keep the agenda local. It does not resolve an issue and neither should it be expected to � unless it is to hand over or take back someone who has unwittingly crossed the LoC. This is because the agenda is usually contentious and the participants are not empowered to dilute the established positions. There have been times when firing has recommenced in the vicinity of a flag meeting, even as the local commanders returned to their respective sides after the meeting. Lasting solutions to even local problems are almost impossible.... contd.
The national selectors, on Tuesday, sprang a surprise by naming uncapped all-rounder Stuart Binny in the 16-member squad for the five-match ODI series in New Zealand that starts at Napier on January 19. Binny replaces Yuvraj Singh, the out-of-form all-rounder who was instrumental in India winning the 2011 World Cup. Yuvraj in his last 8 outings had scored 118 runs.Binny, whose father Roger was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team and is presently one of the selectors, had been a stand-out performer for Rajasthan Royals in last season's Indian Premier League. The medium pacer cum lower order batsman scored 293 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 147.23 and took six wickets with an economy rate of 6.75. Turning up for Karnataka, he has cored 281 runs from six Ranji Trophy games and took 11 wickets. This comes after a dream 2012-13 season when the 29-year-old finished with 612 runs at 47.07 and took 19 wickets at 41.89.With New Zealand expected to welcome India with green-tops, there was a school of thought that the selections should pick a technically proficient specialist who had the skills to negotiate the moving ball. After scoring 280 runs in two Tests in South Africa, Cheteshwar Pujara was the man. But by going for a a bits and pieces players, it is clear the Pujara doesn't seem to be figure in the scheme of things as the selectors look test players for the next year's World Cup that will be jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia.Pujara's List A average is 54.57 in 68 matches. He scored 199 runs in five List A games when he led India A to a tri-series in South Africa in August. Binny, on the other hand, has a List A average of 22.30 in 48 matches, though it has to be said he bats down the order. He also has 37 wickets at 36.64. In the three matches he played for India A in South Africa he scored six runs.... contd.
Asking India to take advantage of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's "genuine interest" in improving ties, Pakistan's new envoy to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani has said New Delhi will "lose a big opportunity if they do not."Jilani, who had earlier served in the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, said Sharif had "genuine interest" in improving relations with India."They will lose a big opportunity if they do not," Jilani, the former foreign secretary, was quoted as saying by the Dawn.Speaking on Afghanistan, he said the complete withdrawal of American troops from the war-torn country is not desirable."Even the talk of US pullout has started having its impact. Pakistan has started to receive more Afghan refugees than before," he said. "This shows that the people of Afghanistan too have fears."The US plans to withdraw most of its combat troops from Afghanistan by December 2014, although it intends to leave behind a smaller force to help the Afghan government. The Pak-US relationship will enter a critical phase this year. The Pakistani security establishment fears that India will fill up the vacuum created by the withdrawal.Pakistan claims India is using Afghan territory for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, a charge denied by New Delhi.On the other hand, India is wary of Pakistan's role in post-2014 Afghanistan, especially the military's links with militant groups like the Haqqani network, as it believes this will give Islamabad impetus for re-starting the Kashmir jihad.Jilani, who reached Washington on Saturday, said his first priority would be strengthening trade and economic ties with the world's economic superpower."Defence and security ties obviously are equally important but cooperation in the energy sector would be the main task that one has to carry forward."He agreed with the suggestion that 2014 would be crucial for determining America's role in South Asia, but said it's still early to�speculate how the situation would shape up. ... contd.
Police say an explosion in Prague has killed the Palestinian ambassador in the Czech Republic.Ambassador Jamel al-Jamal was in his apartment with his family at the time of the explosion on Wednesday, according to Palestinian Embassy spokesman Nabil El-Fahel.  Al-Jamal was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital, where he died, according to police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the blast occurred when the 56-year-old diplomat was moving an old office safe box.  It was not immediately clear how the explosives got there, and the ministry said the blast was being investigated.Prague rescue service spokeswoman Jirina Ernestova said al-Jamal was placed in a medically induced coma when he arrived at Prague Military Hospital. She said a 52-year old woman was taken to a different hospital in Prague after suffering from shock.The ambassador's apartment is in Prague's Suchdol neighborhood.
A fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami leader was Tuesday killed in Bangladesh in a clash with security forces as the opposition geared up for a non-stop nationwide blockade from the New Year to derail the January 5 polls.Police said local Jamaat leader Abdul Jabbar was killed in a clash between the opposition activists and joint forces, comprising paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and police, in western Meherpur district, bordering India."The members of the law enforcement agencies were injured in the gunfight," a police official told a TV channel.In the capital Dhaka, BNP activists took out processions and exploded bombs in old part of the city as it called for a nationwide protest Tuesday.The main opposition BNP led by Khaleda Zia Monday night called for the nationwide blockade of roads, railways and waterways after it was barred for the second consecutive day from staging the "march for democracy" in the capital.The BNP-led 18-party alliance has been demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and scrapping of the polls.BNP Chairperson's Advisor Khandker Mahbub Hossain said the non-stop nationwide blockade starting from January 1 would continue until further announcement.He asked opposition activists to stage "peaceful" protest rallies across the country Tuesday as a warm-up exercise.The opposition has dubbed the polls as "farcical" as over half of the candidates in the 300-seat parliament were set to be declared unopposed in the absence of rival contenders from the opposition.The alliance earlier enforced identical blockades for nearly a month from November 26 after the Election Commission declared the schedule for the polls amid stalemate over the nature of poll-time government.

The US  is still reviewing the application for the transfer of senior Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade to UN and issue the necessary documents to her for full diplomatic immunity, a top American official said."It is under review. We cannot predict when that review will be complete," said a State Department spokesperson in response to a question on the status of the UN request to grant full diplomatic status to 39-year-old Khobragade.The State Department had received her application from the  United Nations in New York on December 20. Normally, the State Department takes a decision on this very quickly, but this time the US  is taking an unusually long time."We cannot compare this to previous requests as each request is evaluated on its own merits," the spokesperson said on Tuesday.Khobragade was arrested on December 12 on charges of visa fraud and misrepresentation. At the time of her arrest, she was Deputy Consul General at the Indian Consulate in New York. The US says, in this capacity, she did not had full diplomatic immunity.Days after her arrest, the Indian government transferred Khobragade to the permanent mission of India to the United Nations (UN), with the view that this would give her the necessary diplomatic immunity.India has strongly objected to her arrest, and in protest has withdrawn many of the diplomatic privileges granted to the American diplomats in India.As one enters the New Year, the Indian diplomat continues to remain in the US without diplomatic immunity. She is currently on bail bond of USD 250,000 and her passport is in possession of the court.

Irfan Pathan didn't get a game as India won the Champions Trophy in England earlier this year. Before the tournament, the pacer all-rounder was seen as someone who would give the perfect balance to the side playing away from the sub-continent. The world was in for a surprise, as the pitches in England turned out to be dry and abrasive. Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja couldn't believe their luck. The two spinners snapped 20 wickets between them.Seven months on, the focus has now shifted to the next big ICC event�the ODI World Cup in Australia-New Zealand early next year. Once again the guessing game has started. There is a general consensus in the cricketing circles that the pitches at Perth, Sydney, Dunedin or  Napier will provide lateral movement and the conditions will make the ball swing in the air. And that's the reason, 29-year-old Stuart Binny finds himself in the  ODI squad for the New Zealand tour. The Karnataka all-rounder has piled runs, taken wickets and, most importantly, shed weight. It remains to be seen if Binny will be pacer-all rounder who will exploit the conditions and come handy with both bat and ball during the World Cup next year. This plan will work provided the pitches Down Under behave the way they have historically done.  Along with a pacer-all rounder, the national selectors also seem to be looking for a tearaway speedsters, who can intimidate the rivals and give the team early breakthroughs. Till recently, Umesh Yadav fitted that bill perfectly. But after he picked up just one wicket in pace-friendly conditions in South Africa, there was a need for another audition. This resulted in Varun Aaron, the bowler capable of  bowling upwards of 145 kph, getting a call. Mohit Sharma making way for Ishwar Pandey, two pacers with similar skill sets, too is a case of weighing all options. Sharma and Yadav haven't been written off it is just that they have been asked to wait in the wings. This isn't a case of chopping and changing. This is selectors taking a stock of the arsenal at their disposal.  ... contd.
Till death do us part! Archaeologists have discovered mysterious 3,500-year-old Bronze Age graves in Siberia, where male and female skeletons are buried facing each other and holding hands.Dozens of the ancient burials in Staryi Tartas village, in Novosibirsk region, contain the bones of couples, facing each other, some with their hands held together.Others show men or women buried with children, 'The Siberian Times' reported.Archaeologists hope that modern genetic tools and DNA tests will help shed some light in the next few years.Establishing genetic links between the bodies might help them understand why they were buried together.A number of theories have been fielded about these Andronovo burials. One such theory is that after the man died, his wife was killed and buried with him.Another version suggests that some of the couples were deliberately buried as if in a sexual act, possibly with a young woman sacrificed to play this role in the grave.One more theory is that, between 17th and 14th century BC, couples were probably buried together to emphasise the importance of nuclear families as a unit, even in death, so they demonstrate the importance attached by these ancient people to this form of relationship."We can fantasise a lot about all this. We can allege that husband died and the wife was killed to be interred with him as we see in some Scythian burials, or maybe the grave stood open for some time and they buried the other person or persons later, or maybe it was really simultaneous death," Professor Molodin, Director of Research of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said.
It's a fair bet Michael Clarke won't be booed at the Sydney Cricket Ground this week when he sets out to become just the third Australia captain to achieve a 5-0 sweep over England in an Ashes series.Three years ago, Australian frustrations at their team's humiliation by a rampant England boiled over with some vociferous catcalling when Clarke, standing in for the injured Ricky Ponting, came out to bat in the fifth Test.Australia lost that series 3-1 with Clarke assuming the captaincy permanently not long afterwards and, although it has not always been a smooth path since, his team look more settled and confident than at any time in his reign.Victories by 381 runs, 218 runs, 150 runs and eight wickets  are Testimony to crushing Australian superiority in the first four Ashes Tests and Clarke's men will be going all out to drive home their advantage when the fifth gets underway on Friday."We want to win this match, we know we've got to do all the hard work and we're looking at this like a final," said pace bowler Mitchell Johnson, whose 31 wickets at an average 14.32 have been a key factor in Australia's"We know they are going to come out fighting hard. They're not going to want to lose 5-0."That fight back from a team that was number one in the world as recently as August 2012 has long been anticipated.The 3-0 home Ashes series triumph earlier this year and the two that preceded it in 2009 and 2010-11 are now distant memories and nothing in the performances in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Melbourne suggests England can turn things around in Sydney.Two key players are no longer with the touring party with batsman Jonathan Trott having returned home to deal with some psychological issues and spinner Graeme Swann retiring after the Ashes were relinquished in Perth.... contd.
Lack of a good night's sleep may damage your brain in a similar way to being hit on the head, a new study has warned.The study from Uppsala University, Sweden, shows that one night of sleep deprivation increases morning blood concentrations of molecules NSE and S-100B in healthy young men.These molecules are typically found in the brain. Thus, their rise in blood after sleep loss may indicate that a lack of sleep may result in loss of brain tissue, researchers said.Fifteen normal-weight men participated in the study. In one condition they were sleep-deprived for one night, while in the other condition they slept for approximately 8 hours."We observed that a night of total sleep loss was followed by increased blood concentrations of NSE and S-100B. These brain molecules typically rise in blood under conditions of brain damage," said sleep researcher Christian Benedict at the Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, who led the study."Thus, our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neuro degenerative processes," said Benedict. "In conclusion, the findings of our trial indicate that a good night's sleep may be critical for maintaining brain health," said Benedict. The findings are published in the journal SLEEP. 
Putting to rest all speculations, it was today confirmed that star wrestlers Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt will compete in 74kg and 65kg categories respectively at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games to avoid face-off against each other.However, in the FILA competitions, including the world and the continental championships, they will compete in 70kg and 65kg categories.Two-time Olympic champion Sushil and London Games bronze medallist Yogeshwar, who were competing in the 66kg and 60kg freestyle respectively before FILA's announcement to rejig weight classes, have conveyed their decision to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) after a series of discussions with the national coaches.As a result of their decision, Sushil and Yogeshwar will be seen competing in the 70kg and 65kg in the Colorado Springs tournament which will mark their return to the international arena since the 2012 London Games.This will be the first time post FILA's announcement that the two star grapplers will compete in the higher weight categories in the Dave Schultz Memorial International tournament from January 30 to February 1 in the USA."Sushil has decided to compete in 70kg for the FILA competitions while for Olympic qualifiers, Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, he has decided to move to 74kg to avoid any face-off against Yogeshwar. His childhood buddy Yogeshwar has also decided to move to 65kg from his traditional 60kg for Olympic events and FILA championships," chief national coach Vinod Kumar told PTI."The decision was arrived at after a series of talks with both the wrestlers. It was a tough decision but was taken keeping in mind the interest of our nation," he added.Sushil has struggled every time he had to reduce his weight to compete in 66kg. Yogeshwar has won his Olympic medal in the 60kg category in 2012 while Sushil competed in 66kg for his historic silver at the London Games.... contd.
Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were dismissed cheaply in yet another pathetic batting show by Delhi, who are now staring at a big defeat against table toppers Karnataka in their final Ranji Trophy group league match, here today.Having conceded a first innings lead of 87 runs after Karnataka scored 289 in their first innings, Delhi were tottering at 132 for six at stumps on day three with a lead of 45 runs and four wickets in hand.Sehwag's (11) woeful first-class season might have ended today as he was trapped by a HS Sharath delivery that hit him below knee-roll having cut back a little. The umpire had little hesitation in giving him out.He had slashed one for four over slips in his 34-ball stay. Sehwag's Ranji season ended with 234 runs at a dismal average of less than 20 in 13 innings with a second innings 50 against Haryana.It will be highly unlikely that Sehwag will be picked in the North Zone team with the likes of Jiwanjot Singh and even his opening partner Gambhir (578) having scored lot more than him. It was a pity to see the 35-year old bespectacled opener struggle against unknown domestic bowlers even on benign pitches.Gambhir (26) again played those streaky shots through the slips with only confident boundary being clip through mid-wicket. He was dismissed before Sehwag when a ball kept low and he didn't commit fully on frontfoot as it thudded on the pads. Manan Sharma was also adjudged leg before by Ronit More (3/27) when a delivery hit him low as Delhi were 41 for three going into tea.Mithun Manhas (32) hit some flowing boundaries and just as he was getting into the groove, Shreyas Gopal's acrobatic catch off his own bowling saw him head back to pavilion.... contd.
Every year, kids with big forehands and bigger ambitions, are subjected to a plethora of voices. Some voices are from within, others they can do without. The players who find success at an early age, few in number, are usually the ones that managed to weed out the wrong from the right.Yuki Bhambri was one of those few.In 2009, at just 17, he was the Australian Open boys' singles champion � a junior Grand Slam champion, just like Bernard Tomic had been in the previous year in Melbourne and Grigor Dimitrov had been in the previous year in New York.But while Tomic and Dimitrov soon found their calling as professionals with career high rankings in the low 20s, the voices had caught up with Bhambri.When Dimitrov and Tomic boasted of reaching the third round and quarterfinals of the French and Wimbledon respectively, Bhambri � who is yet to make the main draw of a Slam � played hard to make the second round of the Chennai Open. Before this week began, he had gotten there once in six attempts.The critics sharpened their vocal cords. Some blamed his game. Few wagged fingers at his fitness. Others faulted the facilities around him. By August this year, his ranking fell to a low of 593. All this, while his first round opponent at the 2014 Chennai Open, 22-year old Pablo Carreno Busta, moved astonishingly from a ranking of 700 something to 64th in the last 12 months.On Tuesday, Bhambri and Busta, boys who had crossed each other in opposite directions on the ladder, met. Dealing with those sniggering voices must not have been easy, but the Indian stepped it up on Chennai's show court to bridge the gap.A straight sets win (6-4, 6-3) in the first round of an ATP 250 event may not be much, but for Bhambri it was one step taken on a long and arduous journey ahead. At Nungambakkam on New Year's eve, Bhambri showed that he had the game and the tenacity to walk the remainder of that journey, with a strong and clinical performance.... contd.
The Jammu and Kashmir State Accountability Commission � set up to probe charges of corruption against ruling politicians � on Tuesday ordered a regular inquiry against Minister for Consumer Affairs & Public Distribution, Choudhary Mohammad Ramzan.Ramzan had allegedly encroached on a green belt and a portion of the road to construct a palatial bungalow which was in violation of the design approved by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation.The commission, including Chairperson Justice U P Nargotra and Justice Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain, noted that the minister had not rebutted the allegations that he encroached upon colony land and a portion of the road despite being issued a notice. They held that his continuous absence and failure to file a response, prima facie raises the presumption that the complaint against him is correct. While ordering that a complaint be registered against Ramzan, the commission also issued him a notice asking him to appear before it and file a defence statement within six weeks.The allegation was leveled by housing society, Friends Enclave Consumer cum Welfare Cooperative Humhama Heights, Srinagar, through Dr G N Yatoo and accused the minister of violating the design approved by Srinagar Municipal Corporation.Ramzan is the second minister in Omar Abdullah's Cabinet to face a regular inquiry by State Accountability Commission. In May, it had ordered an inquiry against Deputy CM Tara Chand for making illegal appointments in urban local bodies department, which was earlier headed by him.
A refreshed Roger Federer's clinical demolition of Jarkko Nieminen in his first match of 2014 suggested he could be a factor in the first major of the year.His debut appearance at the Brisbane International was rapturously greeted by tournament organisers and fans alike, but following his first year without a grand slam final appearance since 2002 it was not certain what stage of decline the Swiss ace was in.A 6-4 6-2 victory over his tough Finnish opponent hinted that he was ready to put on a competitive showing at Melbourne Park, now relieved of the back problems that dogged his 2013 campaign and contributed to his second and fourth-round exits at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open."I'm actually very clear in my mind," Federer told reporters. "Now it's just down to forehands and backhands and tactics and movement. That's kind of what you want it to be, because unfortunately it hasn't always been that way last year with my issues."The scoreline flattered Federer in some ways. Both men eked out four break points over the two sets and Nieminen fought on level terms at the baseline, hitting eye-catching forehand winners throughout.Federer's mastery of the pivotal points of the match showed the steel behind the game's most graceful player remained firmly in place and his preference for playing new tournaments is far from a retirement tour.For the crucial break of the first set he came from 0-40 down in the fifth game and then saved a break point on his own serve to build a two-game cushion.IMPERIOUS BESTIn the second stanza he immediately grabbed the initiative, breaking in the first game and with his serve at near its imperious best he never looked like letting the advantage slip."I expect myself to play a bit better in the next match, even though today was already very good for a first match in so many weeks," Federer said.... contd.
At the end of the first day's play in Johannesburg, India had batted themselves into a decent position. The score read 255/5, their position looking even more robust because their captain was still at the crease. The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to not just set his record right in conditions outside the subcontinent. This was his chance to ride home the advantage for his team. It wasn't to be though as Dhoni perished, poking at a Vernon Philander delivery leaving him. One that could have been left alone. His dismissal for 19 also set in the rot as India lost their four wickets for not much.It wasn't the only time Dhoni set off a collapse or got out just when the situation called out for him to play a knock of significance. At Durban in the first innings, he and Ajinkya Rahane had helped India regain control with a 50-run stand for the fifth wicket. They had also taken India past the 300-run mark. Then Dhoni, batting on 24, went chasing after another length delivery outside his off-stump with his unique 'walking shot'. This time from a charged-up Steyn. Yet again the Indian skipper had fallen in the same fashion as has become customary of him in conditions where the ball moves around. The most disappointing of the lot was reserved for when India needed Dhoni the most. On the last day of the tour with the visitors hanging by the skin of their teeth to save the second Test and ensure that they walk away with a 0-0 verdict �which would have been akin to a win for India.The South African pacers had just finished their umpteenth spell on the day. Manning the attack now was Robin Peterson bowling from over the wicket into the rough, and hardly turning a ball. Just then Dhoni decided to use his forearms and muscle a length delivery outside his leg-stump over the mid-wicket fielder. Not only was the shot not on, it was also uncalled for considering the situation, especially with Rahane fighting tooth and nail at the other end to keep India's hopes alive. The ball only went as far as Alviro Petersen at mid-wicket. Dhoni could only throw his head sideways in despair. Soon after, the Indian tail lived up to their reputation and was blown away.... contd.
New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson scored the quickest century ever in international cricket on Wednesday, taking just 36 balls against West Indies to break the record long held by Pakistan's Shahid Afridi.Afridi scored a 37-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in 1996 and had remained the fastest across all formats of the international game since.Anderson, 23, brought up the mark with his 12th six of the innings after the third one-day international in Queenstown was reduced to a 21-over match due to rain.Fastest ODI 100sBalls36 C Anderson 201437 S Afridi 199644 M Boucher 200645 B Lara 199945 S Afridi 200546 J Ryder 2014#NZvWINew Zealand captain Brendon McCullum (33 off 11 balls) started the onslaught before Jesse Ryder (104), who completed his hundred in 46 balls, and Anderson added 191 runs for the fourth wicket."It's one of those things you don't plan on doing when you go out there but obviously with it (being) a reduced game it makes it easier to go harder at it earlier and Brendon showed his intent early on and Jesse played an unbelievable innings as well," Anderson said in a televised interview."I think we went pretty good together. I was hitting boundaries and he was hitting boundaries. It was just one of those things that comes off."I think me and Jesse were thinking every ball was going to get us out or go for six so it was nice to have that feeling out there and get them out of the middle."Anderson remained unbeaten on 131 off 47 balls with 14 sixes and half a dozen fours to take New Zealand to a mammoth 283 for four wickets in their innings.Asked if he was aware of the record, the left-hander said: "No. I didn't have a clue actually. It's not like I look it up and take it down but I guess it's nice to have that."
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
It is inevitable that the latest call-up to the Indian ODI squad, Stuart Binny would face additional scrutiny for being the son of selector Roger Binny. However, at least on the day he made the cut for the New Zealand tour, Binny Junior, gave enough and more testament to his ability with a game-changing knock albeit in a different format. Coming into bat with his side both stuck in first gear on a tricky Feroze Shah Kotla pitch and precariously placed at 73/4 after 35 overs, Binny resurrected the innings, hitting six sixes and seven boundaries in a 94-ball 88. Binny would be dismissed with Karnataka two runs short of Delhi's first innings total 202, but his side eventually took the first innings lead and at stumps were comfortably placed at  226/5.While Binny's knock essentially pulled the rug from under Delhi's feet. The hosts needed to win the game to have any chance of progressing to the knock outs, were hamstrung from the start of the day.  Poor visibility delayed the start for close to two hours and it stayed bad enough for umpires to force spinner Varun Sood and military medium Rajat Bhatia to bowl first, instead of Ashish Nehra and Sumit Narwal, who would have been best-placed to take advantage of overcast conditions. Bhatia though delivered for Delhi by bowling opener Mayank Agarwal in his first over. Eventually the light improved enough for Nehra to be introduced, and the pacer got R Samarth pulling to Sood at square leg. The pitch wasn't giving much turn but had no pace on it either, forcing batsmen to generate all the power. In addition the ball was keeping low and through two such deliveries, Varun Sood got last match's centurion Manish Pandey and Abrar Kazi out LBW. ... contd.

Buoyed by victories in MP, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, it looks at 156 LS seats of UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka as key to 2014Firmly entrenched in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP  is looking at another set of three states that it believes holds the key to realising its Lok Sabha hopes for 2014."Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka are make or break for our 2014 dreams," stressed a BJP functionary considered close to prime ministerial candidate  Narendra Modi, speaking to The Indian Express days after the party won the assembly elections in the first three states.Not among the big targets is Bihar, which has 40 Lok Sabha seats and saw a bitter parting of ways with the JD(U). "Repeating or marginally bettering our tally without JD(U) support will be good enough, while larger gains will be a bonus," said the party leader. The BJP holds 12 seats out of the 15 it contested while in the alliance.In the states won, the BJP is banking on recent trends that have seen the party winning assembly polls frequently bagging most of that state's Lok Sabha seats, too. It is confident the leadership of Raman Singh, Shivraj Chouhan and Vasundhara Raje will take the burden off the central leadership.These three states account for only 65 Lok Sabha seats while UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka have 156. The BJP faces a Congress that has been holding its ground in Maharashtra and Karnataka and gained some in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha polls.Uttar PradeshIt is the obvious focus given its 80 seats. The BJP's first stint at power in New Delhi in 1996 had hinged on a robust performance in this state, though from 57 seats in 1998 (undivided UP) it slipped to 29 in 1999 following a rebellion by Kalyan Singh � who has since merged his party into the BJP. Close Modi aide Amit Shah, given charge of UP, has been consulting Kalyan on strategies to revive the party. Part of the strategy is nine mega rallies across regions by Modi, who has already held four and is slated to undertake three more and wind up in Lucknow before February-end when the actual campaign begins. Shah too has been touring the state and plans to visit at least 52 constituencies to put a setup in place. He has set the state organisation a target of 1.25 lakh booth committees.... contd.
A day after fulfilling his promise to supply free water, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday kept his word to slash electricity prices in the national capital and audit the private power distribution companies. Following a meeting of the Delhi Cabinet, Kejriwal announced the government would provide a 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units a month. "As promised the AAP government  has slashed 50 per cent of the rates by giving a subsidy on the tariff. This will impact at least 28 lakh households in Delhi. Economically weaker sections of society will benefit from this decision," Kejriwal said.The subsidy is expected to cost the state Rs 200 crore per quarter until the end of the financial year in March. However, Kejriwal said it would cost Rs 61 crore. "Rs 61 crore will be given to Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited. But the remaining Rs 139 crore approximately will be given to government companies that are providing services and supply power to BSES Yamuna Private Limited and BSES Rajdhani Private Limited. And it will be adjusted from the accounts of BSES companies as they are yet to pay dues worth Rs 4,500 crore," the new chief minister said.Asked whether the government could give a subsidy when a regulator is in place, Kejriwal said: "The government has powers to give subsidy." Both discoms refused to comment on the subsidy when reached for their view. Kejriwal also announced a CAG audit into the finances of the three private power distribution companies. "The discoms have 24 hours to submit their objections on government views on the proposal for audit of their finances," he said. Kejriwal met CAG officials before chairing the Cabinet meeting and said the government auditor had in principle agreed to conduct the audit.... contd.
Police say an explosion in Prague has killed the Palestinian ambassador in the Czech Republic.Ambassador Jamel al-Jamal was in his apartment with his family at the time of the explosion on Wednesday, according to Palestinian Embassy spokesman Nabil El-Fahel.  Al-Jamal was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital, where he died, according to police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the blast occurred when the 56-year-old diplomat was moving an old office safe box.  It was not immediately clear how the explosives got there, and the ministry said the blast was being investigated.Prague rescue service spokeswoman Jirina Ernestova said al-Jamal was placed in a medically induced coma when he arrived at Prague Military Hospital. She said a 52-year old woman was taken to a different hospital in Prague after suffering from shock.The ambassador's apartment is in Prague's Suchdol neighborhood.
These have been a frustrating few weeks for Iqbal Abdulla. Despite some decent performances under his belt, like his four-wicket haul against Punjab, the selectors continued to give the left-arm spinner a cold shoulder repeatedly pointing out he wasn't up to the mark. However, with Mumbai playing at Gujarat and under pressure to win and qualify for the knockout stages, the selectors persisted with the tried-and-tested spinner. Perhaps, his past performance at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium here worked for him. His last five-wicket haul had come at this venue against the same opposition back in 2008.On Tuesday, Abdulla repaid the selectors' faith and justified his selection by picking up six wickets in the do-or-die game, keeping Mumbai's hopes of making the quarter-finals alive. Defending a meagre total of 154, Abdulla's fine spell marginally helped apply the skid-breaks on Gujarat and stop them from running away with the game as they notched up 253, a lead of 99. At stumps on Day Two, the visitors were 76 for four, still trailing by 23 runs, and staring at the steepest challenge of the season.But earlier on Tuesday, realising they needed quick wickets to stand any chance of making a comeback, Mumbai began on a bright note with medium-pacer Shardul Thakur removing Parthiv Patel soon after play began. Then, it was the time for Abdulla show.Ever since Mumbai found another left-arm spinner in Vishal Dabholkar last season, Abdulla's spot in the starting XI has been uncertain. Experts suggested he was more suited to the T20 format as he lacked variations and did not have a traditional spin bowlers' approach.However, he proved them wrong on Tuesday. He kept up the pressure from one end and looked the only bowler who could run through Gujarat's line-up. Abdulla added to his overnight tally by trapping opener Samit Gohel in front of stumps. Manprit Juneja, who himself is going through a rough patch, started well but was caught at slips by Wasim Jaffer off Abdulla.

Dubai has ushered in 2014 with more than half a million fireworks spectacle, breaking the world record for the largest such display ever, Guinness World records said today.Ten months in planning, over 500,000 fireworks were used during the display on the New Year's Eve which lasted around six minutes, with Guinness adjudicators on hand to confirm that a new record had been set.Covering a distance of over 94km of the city's seafront, the display incorporated some of Dubai's top landmarks, including Palm Jumeirah, World Islands, the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab, Guinness said.The spectacle's final salvo of fireworks created an artificial "sunrise" along the seafront, with the highest fireworks reaching more than one kilometre in height.Organisers had been aiming to beat a record set in 2012 during a display to mark Kuwait's golden jubilee anniversary which saw a total of 77,282 fireworks launched.Dubai's attempt broke that benchmark by some margin, with enough fireworks launched within the first minute of the display alone to surpass the previous record.What now goes down as the biggest bang in the history of pyrotechnics was designed by US firm Fireworks by Grucci, said Guinness.The performance used 100 computers to synchronise the pyrotechnics, along with a choreographed musical soundtrack.In the build up to the event, more than 200 expert technicians worked 5,000 man hours to ensure that the fireworks' timing was accurate down to the millisecond."The scale of this record attempt is truly impressive and will ensure all eyes are on Dubai," Alistair Richards, Global President of Guinness World Records, said.Richards had travelled especially to Dubai from London to witness the display.

The left-armer didn't have much trouble finishing off Gujarat's tail-enders Chirag Gandhi, Rakesh Dhruv and Ishwar Choudhary.... contd.
At the end of the first day's play in Johannesburg, India had batted themselves into a decent position. The score read 255/5, their position looking even more robust because their captain was still at the crease. The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to not just set his record right in conditions outside the subcontinent. This was his chance to ride home the advantage for his team. It wasn't to be though as Dhoni perished, poking at a Vernon Philander delivery leaving him. One that could have been left alone. His dismissal for 19 also set in the rot as India lost their four wickets for not much.It wasn't the only time Dhoni set off a collapse or got out just when the situation called out for him to play a knock of significance. At Durban in the first innings, he and Ajinkya Rahane had helped India regain control with a 50-run stand for the fifth wicket. They had also taken India past the 300-run mark. Then Dhoni, batting on 24, went chasing after another length delivery outside his off-stump with his unique 'walking shot'. This time from a charged-up Steyn. Yet again the Indian skipper had fallen in the same fashion as has become customary of him in conditions where the ball moves around. The most disappointing of the lot was reserved for when India needed Dhoni the most. On the last day of the tour with the visitors hanging by the skin of their teeth to save the second Test and ensure that they walk away with a 0-0 verdict �which would have been akin to a win for India.The South African pacers had just finished their umpteenth spell on the day. Manning the attack now was Robin Peterson bowling from over the wicket into the rough, and hardly turning a ball. Just then Dhoni decided to use his forearms and muscle a length delivery outside his leg-stump over the mid-wicket fielder. Not only was the shot not on, it was also uncalled for considering the situation, especially with Rahane fighting tooth and nail at the other end to keep India's hopes alive. The ball only went as far as Alviro Petersen at mid-wicket. Dhoni could only throw his head sideways in despair. Soon after, the Indian tail lived up to their reputation and was blown away.... contd.
On Monday night, when the temperature dropped to near zero in Muzaffarnagar district   and rain added to the chill, the district administration informed 300 families living out in the open for the last four months that they had 24 hours to pack up and leave.In adjoining Shamli, where riot refugees have been huddling in 12 relief camps, district authorities told community leaders "hosting" them that they had until January 4 to empty out the camps completely.Consequently, over Monday and Tuesday, 483 families piled their children and belongings together on 30-odd government tempos and trucks and left, pulling their buffaloes and goats alongside. Some 2,000 of those who left had fled from Fugana village, where the largest number of riot FIRs were registered, including six of gangrape.Some of them headed to the wet, muddy pieces of open land they have purchased in Loi or Neem Kheda with the Rs 5-lakh compensation the government has given them; others sought out a small bit of courtyard or a verandah in the home of a generous benefactor in Loi.Still others went in search of shelter in two rooms at a government school in Muzaffarnagar, or in the cluster of 70-odd houses that the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind is building in Khampur.On Tuesday, many of these families sat huddled at the bus stand in Neem Kheda, apparently with nowhere else to go. A few of the men struggled to erect cloth or plastic sheets above their heads; others simply sat or lay exhausted on charpais in the open, getting gently soaked in the fine rain that fell."Jab rakshak bhakshak ban jaye toh kya hoga? This time not only the state authorities but also the village pradhan turned against us. They said paperwork for the compensation could continue, but we needed to get off land owned by the government, and to protect ourselves from the cold. How are we being protected from the cold here?" said 23-year-old Afsana, as she pulled some donated woollens on her children Kashish, 2, and Sahir, 4.... contd.
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said on Tuesday that while the "general impression" about BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is that he is "divisive", a section of people feels that he will be able to take "certain tough decisions... maybe positive ones" (on the Kashmir issue)."Modi has a mixed response (in the Valley). Some people don't like him, mainly because J&K is a Muslim majority state � not that there haven't been communal riots before Gujarat. Riots have taken place before Gujarat riots and after that too � in Assam and more recently in Muzaffarnagar. But when it comes to Gujarat, people saw the pictures and can't forget them," she said, speaking at the Idea Exchange programme at The Indian Express."But there is another section of people which probably thinks that maybe Modi is the one who will have such authority that he will be able to take certain tough decisions (regarding Kashmir issue). Decisions like Vajpayee took. Otherwise no other prime minister has ever taken any tough decision. When militancy was at its peak, he (Vajpayee) went to Lahore on the bus yatra. The same day, seven Hindu boys were killed... Even after Kargil, he invited the Pakistan President. And then Parliament (attack) happened," recalled Mufti."I think people have this impression that if Modi comes, he may be able to take certain tough decisions, maybe positive ones, because he did say at a rally in Jammu that he was going to follow Vajpayee's policies. But this impression is not shared by everybody, just a section. The general impression is that he is divisive," she said.On the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Mufti said, "Even the Kashmir Valley is celebrating this change of people who are not conventional politicians winning. Basically, in the Valley, the mainstream national parties are seen as untouchable because, firstly, they are seen as bad, and secondly, they are seen as being connected to Delhi. So, I think this example of AAP may make people change their mind... People may start believing that it (politics) is not so bad, it can have a positive impact too."... contd.
Kim Jong Un boasted Wednesday that North Korea enters the new year on a surge of strength because of the elimination of "factionalist filth" � a reference to the young leader's once powerful uncle, whose execution last month raised questions about Kim's grip on power. Kim's comments in an annual New Year's Day message, which included a call for improved ties with Seoul but also a warning of a possible "nuclear catastrophe," will be scrutinised by outside analysts and governments for clues about the opaque country's intentions and policy goals.Already widespread worry about the country has deepened since Kim publicly humiliated and then executed his uncle and mentor, one of the biggest political developments in Pyongyang in years, and certainly since Kim took power two years ago after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.North Korea's "resolute" action to "eliminate factionalist filth" within the ruling Workers' Party has bolstered the country's unity "by 100 times," Kim said in a speech broadcast by state TV. He didn't mention by name his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, long considered the country's No. 2 power.But Kim included rhetoric that some analysts saw as a first step to renewing dialogue with rival Seoul. Kim called for an improvement in strained ties with South Korea, saying it's time for each side to stop slandering the other and urging Seoul to listen to voices calling for Korean unification.That language, which is similar to that of past New Year's messages, is an obvious improvement on last year's threats of nuclear war, though there is still skepticism in Washington and Seoul about Pyongyang's intentions.North Korea's authoritarian, secretive government is extremely difficult for outsiders to interpret, and analysts are divided about the meaning of Jang's execution on treason charges. Many, however, believe that the purge shows Kim Jong Un struggling to establish the same absolute power that his father and grandfather enjoyed.... contd.
Proprietors of the first marijuana retailers licensed to sell pot for recreational use in Colorado were busy rolling joints and stocking up their leafy merchandise ahead of a grand opening on Wednesday that marks a new chapter in America's drug culture.Thirteen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers who are interested in nothing more than its mind- and mood-altering properties were slated to begin welcoming customers as early as 8 a.m. local time.When they do, they will be launching an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross $578 million in annual revenues, including $67 million in tax receipts for the state.Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters.But starting New Year's Day, cannabis will be legally produced, sold to the general public and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of Colorado.Due to the novelty factor, operators of the first group of retailers slated to open their doors in the Denver area and a handful of other locations were anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed.Inside a warehouse tucked away in the blue-collar Denver suburb of Northglenn, a trio of workers were feverishly rolling hundreds of marijuana cigarettes by hand in preparation for the onslaught."We expect to have 2,000 joints ready to go by the time we open," said Robin Hackett, 51, co-owner of Botana Care, who said she expects between 800 to 1,000 customers to patronize her store the first day.The store has hired a private security firm to help with traffic and parking issues that might arise.... contd.
Asking India to take advantage of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's "genuine interest" in improving ties, Pakistan's new envoy to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani has said New Delhi will "lose a big opportunity if they do not."Jilani, who had earlier served in the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, said Sharif had "genuine interest" in improving relations with India."They will lose a big opportunity if they do not," Jilani, the former foreign secretary, was quoted as saying by the Dawn.Speaking on Afghanistan, he said the complete withdrawal of American troops from the war-torn country is not desirable."Even the talk of US pullout has started having its impact. Pakistan has started to receive more Afghan refugees than before," he said. "This shows that the people of Afghanistan too have fears."The US plans to withdraw most of its combat troops from Afghanistan by December 2014, although it intends to leave behind a smaller force to help the Afghan government. The Pak-US relationship will enter a critical phase this year. The Pakistani security establishment fears that India will fill up the vacuum created by the withdrawal.Pakistan claims India is using Afghan territory for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, a charge denied by New Delhi.On the other hand, India is wary of Pakistan's role in post-2014 Afghanistan, especially the military's links with militant groups like the Haqqani network, as it believes this will give Islamabad impetus for re-starting the Kashmir jihad.Jilani, who reached Washington on Saturday, said his first priority would be strengthening trade and economic ties with the world's economic superpower."Defence and security ties obviously are equally important but cooperation in the energy sector would be the main task that one has to carry forward."He agreed with the suggestion that 2014 would be crucial for determining America's role in South Asia, but said it's still early to�speculate how the situation would shape up. ... contd.
India is preparing to participate in the UN-sponsored international conference on Syria to be held in Geneva which will bring together all warring parties, domestic and international, to resolve the crisis and stabilise the Arab country.India has been informed very "authentically" about its invitation to Geneva II, scheduled for January, and is awaiting a formal invite in this regard, Foreign Affairs' official spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said here Tuesday.Apart from financial assistance of US$1 million to the trust of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons at The Hague for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and related facilities, India has also offered the services of its experts to help in the destruction of Damascus's chemical weapons arsenal and related facilities. India has maintained that the Syrian conflict should be resolved through dialogue, and has also said it does not support any military intervention by Western powers.India, Saudi to ink agreement on labourNEW DELHI: Saudi Arabia and India are set to ink an important agreement on labour cooperation when the kingdom's Labour Minister Adel Fakieh arrives on a three-day visit on New Year.

Till death do us part! Archaeologists have discovered mysterious 3,500-year-old Bronze Age graves in Siberia, where male and female skeletons are buried facing each other and holding hands.Dozens of the ancient burials in Staryi Tartas village, in Novosibirsk region, contain the bones of couples, facing each other, some with their hands held together.Others show men or women buried with children, 'The Siberian Times' reported.Archaeologists hope that modern genetic tools and DNA tests will help shed some light in the next few years.Establishing genetic links between the bodies might help them understand why they were buried together.A number of theories have been fielded about these Andronovo burials. One such theory is that after the man died, his wife was killed and buried with him.Another version suggests that some of the couples were deliberately buried as if in a sexual act, possibly with a young woman sacrificed to play this role in the grave.One more theory is that, between 17th and 14th century BC, couples were probably buried together to emphasise the importance of nuclear families as a unit, even in death, so they demonstrate the importance attached by these ancient people to this form of relationship."We can fantasise a lot about all this. We can allege that husband died and the wife was killed to be interred with him as we see in some Scythian burials, or maybe the grave stood open for some time and they buried the other person or persons later, or maybe it was really simultaneous death," Professor Molodin, Director of Research of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said.
Camera manufacturers are a worried lot. The improvement in phone cameras have over the past few years eroded almost all of their business in the point and shoot range. Almost everyone clicks pictures these days, but not all are using something that has been built exclusively for the purpose. This is why innovation has become the key to survival in the camera business. Nikon pushed the envelope a bit too far when it launched the D800 with a 36MP sensor, Canon was silent for a while before it thought of the ultra compact 100D. But since then, most of the innovation has happened from Sony, not exactly the first name that comes to your mind when you think of cameras. They launched the stunning RX1, a compact camera with a full-frame sensor, the RX100s that took compact cameras to a whole new level and now the new Sony Alpha a7 and a7R DSLRs, both full-frame mirror-less cameras in very manageable sizes. I put the Sony a7 to the test. Design  The design reminded me a lot of the RX1. In fact, the body is not much larger even though this is a full-frame DSLR. But the RX1, the great camera that it is, would develop a serious complex in front of this one. That is because this has a tiltable LCD panel, a proper eye piece though looking into an electronic OLED viewfinder and whole range of lenses to play with. It is compact, but build like a Colt with a body that will weather most storms, and dust storms, that come its way. All the ports are tucked away behind sturdy flaps. Despite the small built, the camera offers a very steady, DSLR-like, grip. There is a thumb rest near where all the controls are settles. There is a ring here to adjust the settings and another on up front accessible with your fingers. While framing a shot, both these will come in more than handy. There are two customisable buttons that maker life much easier. Plus, you can switch between auto focus and auto exposure lock on the body itself. I would have preferred this to have been a switch for manual focus. ... contd.
A 16-year-old girl, who was gangraped twice in a day around two months ago at Madhyamgram in North 24-Parganas district of West Bengal and had attempted suicide on December 23, succumbed to her injuries here on Tuesday. The victim was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata with 70 per cent burns after she attempted self-immolation in her house near Dum Dum, where her family shifted after the rape incidents.A gang of men raped the girl on October 25. Later the same day, when she was going home along with her father, a taxi driver, and her mother after lodging a complaint, she was again abducted by the same gang and raped, police said. She was found unconscious near the railway tracks.The family had settled in Madhyamgram a year ago, but shifted to Dum Dum after local goons threatened them with dire consequences if they didn't withdraw the rape case.On December 23, an associate of the gang leader barged into their Dum Dum residence and threatened them following which the girl tried to commit suicide.Her father alleged his daughter was not given proper medical treatment. "We repeatedly requested hospital authorities to shift her to the burn unit. But they did not pay attention to us," he said, adding that he has also lodged a case of medical negligence against hospital authorities. The father said nobody from the government visited the family.  "We want justice and we want that the criminals should be hanged," he said.The police have arrested seven persons in the case.

Dubai has ushered in 2014 with more than half a million fireworks spectacle, breaking the world record for the largest such display ever, Guinness World records said today.Ten months in planning, over 500,000 fireworks were used during the display on the New Year's Eve which lasted around six minutes, with Guinness adjudicators on hand to confirm that a new record had been set.Covering a distance of over 94km of the city's seafront, the display incorporated some of Dubai's top landmarks, including Palm Jumeirah, World Islands, the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab, Guinness said.The spectacle's final salvo of fireworks created an artificial "sunrise" along the seafront, with the highest fireworks reaching more than one kilometre in height.Organisers had been aiming to beat a record set in 2012 during a display to mark Kuwait's golden jubilee anniversary which saw a total of 77,282 fireworks launched.Dubai's attempt broke that benchmark by some margin, with enough fireworks launched within the first minute of the display alone to surpass the previous record.What now goes down as the biggest bang in the history of pyrotechnics was designed by US firm Fireworks by Grucci, said Guinness.The performance used 100 computers to synchronise the pyrotechnics, along with a choreographed musical soundtrack.In the build up to the event, more than 200 expert technicians worked 5,000 man hours to ensure that the fireworks' timing was accurate down to the millisecond."The scale of this record attempt is truly impressive and will ensure all eyes are on Dubai," Alistair Richards, Global President of Guinness World Records, said.Richards had travelled especially to Dubai from London to witness the display.
Seven years after the suicide spiral in Vidarbha's six cotton-growing districts touched a record 1,449 in 2006, here's something to celebrate the new year with: the number of deaths fell to about half that number in 2013.The year gone by recorded only 752 suicides , although that number could rise by a few due to some late reporting. It also reflects a markedly improving suicide-to-population ratio considering the significant growth in population in these seven years.The 2013 number has to be seen in relation to that of 2006 since meticulous reporting of all suicides � farmers and non-farmers � in the countryside began that year.The overall figures, generally reported as farmers' suicides, actually include suicides by men, young girls and boys and housewives from farmer and non-farmer households although suicides in farmer households are much higher.The Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, which maintains its own suicide-count, has recorded 824 suicides for 2013 from all 11 districts of the region, including the five that grow paddy.The record low in the number of suicides comes in a year that saw unprecedented havoc caused by rains in the region, killing hundreds of people and thousands of cattle and hurting farming in over 15 lakh hectares.The turnaround in the six cotton and soyabean producing districts of Wardha, Yavatmal, Amravati, Akola, Washim and Buldana, has coincided with concerted government interventions through the chief minister's and Prime Minister's packages - often dubbed failures - as also with the massive spread of Bt cotton, which now covers more than 95 per cent of the region's cotton area and which activists have been blaming for an "increase" in suicides. Almost all these districts have registered the drop consistently from 2006, barring 2010 which saw an increase. The drop has been most significant in Buldana (305 to 120) and Washim (185 to 56), two of the most backward districts of the region. In Amravati, it has gone down to 159 from 270 and in Wardha to 79 from 143. Yavatmal, which routinely registered the highest number of suicides, marked a drop to 219 from 359.... contd.
A refreshed Roger Federer's clinical demolition of Jarkko Nieminen in his first match of 2014 suggested he could be a factor in the first major of the year.His debut appearance at the Brisbane International was rapturously greeted by tournament organisers and fans alike, but following his first year without a grand slam final appearance since 2002 it was not certain what stage of decline the Swiss ace was in.A 6-4 6-2 victory over his tough Finnish opponent hinted that he was ready to put on a competitive showing at Melbourne Park, now relieved of the back problems that dogged his 2013 campaign and contributed to his second and fourth-round exits at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open."I'm actually very clear in my mind," Federer told reporters. "Now it's just down to forehands and backhands and tactics and movement. That's kind of what you want it to be, because unfortunately it hasn't always been that way last year with my issues."The scoreline flattered Federer in some ways. Both men eked out four break points over the two sets and Nieminen fought on level terms at the baseline, hitting eye-catching forehand winners throughout.Federer's mastery of the pivotal points of the match showed the steel behind the game's most graceful player remained firmly in place and his preference for playing new tournaments is far from a retirement tour.For the crucial break of the first set he came from 0-40 down in the fifth game and then saved a break point on his own serve to build a two-game cushion.IMPERIOUS BESTIn the second stanza he immediately grabbed the initiative, breaking in the first game and with his serve at near its imperious best he never looked like letting the advantage slip."I expect myself to play a bit better in the next match, even though today was already very good for a first match in so many weeks," Federer said.... contd.
The national selectors, on Tuesday, sprang a surprise by naming uncapped all-rounder Stuart Binny in the 16-member squad for the five-match ODI series in New Zealand that starts at Napier on January 19. Binny replaces Yuvraj Singh, the out-of-form all-rounder who was instrumental in India winning the 2011 World Cup. Yuvraj in his last 8 outings had scored 118 runs.Binny, whose father Roger was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team and is presently one of the selectors, had been a stand-out performer for Rajasthan Royals in last season's Indian Premier League. The medium pacer cum lower order batsman scored 293 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 147.23 and took six wickets with an economy rate of 6.75. Turning up for Karnataka, he has cored 281 runs from six Ranji Trophy games and took 11 wickets. This comes after a dream 2012-13 season when the 29-year-old finished with 612 runs at 47.07 and took 19 wickets at 41.89.With New Zealand expected to welcome India with green-tops, there was a school of thought that the selections should pick a technically proficient specialist who had the skills to negotiate the moving ball. After scoring 280 runs in two Tests in South Africa, Cheteshwar Pujara was the man. But by going for a a bits and pieces players, it is clear the Pujara doesn't seem to be figure in the scheme of things as the selectors look test players for the next year's World Cup that will be jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia.Pujara's List A average is 54.57 in 68 matches. He scored 199 runs in five List A games when he led India A to a tri-series in South Africa in August. Binny, on the other hand, has a List A average of 22.30 in 48 matches, though it has to be said he bats down the order. He also has 37 wickets at 36.64. In the three matches he played for India A in South Africa he scored six runs.... contd.
Part-time offspinner Gurkeerat Singh and left-arm tweaker Rajwinder Singh finished with match-haul of eight wickets each as Punjab progressed into the knockout round by hammering Jharkhand by an innings and 173 runs in a Ranji Trophy Group A match here today.The result meant that Jharkhand will have to return to Group C after just one season.Off-spinner Gurkeerat took four for 59, while Rajwinder (3/38) and Rahul Sharma (3/15) picked three wickets apiece to skittle Jharkhand for 127 in their second innings at the Railway Stadium.Punjab bowlers took just 34.1 overs to bowl the hosts after they were asked to follow on Punjab skipper Mandeep Singh on day three here.Resuming the day on 210 for 9, Jharkhand could add only six runs to end their first innings 300 run behind Punjab's total of 516.Left-arm spinner Rajwinder added one more wicket to his overnight tally of four, bringing up his second five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.Asked to bat again, Jharkhand failed to negotiate the spin trio of Gurkeerat, Rajwinder and Rahul.Opener Rameez Nemat, who made 81 in the first innings, was the only batsman to resist once again as wickets kept tumbling at the other end.Nemat made 48 off 85 balls, including seven fours.Gurkeerat finished with match figures of eight for 99, while Rajwinder spent 106 runs to claim his eight scalps.Brief Scores:Punjab: 516Jharkhand: 216 & 127 allout 34.1 overs (Rameez Nemat 48, Kumar Deobrat 24; Gurkeerat Singh 4/59)Points: Punjab 7, Jharkhand 0.
The UP government Tuesday appointed 1978-batch IPS officer Rizwan Ahmad as the new Director General of Police (DGP). He is the first Muslim to assume the post in the state.Ahmad replaces  Deo Raj Nagar who retired Tuesday. Ahmad himself will have a short tenure as he is due to retire in February.Ahmad's name for the DGP's post was doing the rounds in the IPS circles since April when former DGP A C Sharma was on his way out. He had overseen arrangements of the iftaar party hosted by CM Akhilesh Yadav. However, Nagar was appointed as the DGP in April.The Akhilesh Yadav government's image has taken severe beating over the condition of post-riot relief camps where 34 children have died due to the cold.Sources in the government said the government was earlier hesitant in appointing Ahmad as DGP given that another Muslim officer, Jawed Usmani, holds the Chief Secretary's post. A native of Ballia, Ahmad was posted as Director General, Railways, since May after he he was shifted from the post of Director General (Telecom). On Tuesday evening, he said boosting the morale of police personnel and maintaining peace in the state will be his priorities.
As Pressure mounted on Himachal CM Virbhadra Singh, the CBI Tuesday clarified that it cannot probe all the corruption charges leveled against him by BJP leader Arun Jaitley without a reference from the state government.CBI officials confirmed they have received a copy of the letter written by Jaitley to PM Manmohan Singh in which he made the allegations. The letter provides details of three cases, out of which two are being investigated by the agency. The third case, the officials said, will need a recommendation from the state government or a court direction to initiate a probe. The CBI will soon inform the PMO on Jaitley's allegations and the progress of the preliminary enquiry (PE) being initiated by it. Sources said the PE against Virbhadra is in final stages and the CBI has collected evidence to probe the case further. The first allegation relates to recovery of diaries by the Income Tax department from the Mumbai-based Ispat Group. The diaries allegedly revealed payoffs to various ministries and some of the entries were marked against the initials of 'VBS' and 'MoS APS'. There were allegedly four entries made against 'VBS', which totalled up to Rs 2.8 crore between October 2009 and October 2010. Virbhadra was steel minister between May 2009 to January 2011. Another allegation against Virbhadra is that a man identified as Anand Chouhan bought LIC policies in the name of the CM and family members totalling Rs 3.80 crore. Chouhan was recently questioned by the CBI for allegedly making deposit of several crores into the Punjab National Bank account in Shimla. The CBI said it will soon seek time from Virbhadra to examine him. "We plan to send a CBI team from Delhi to examine him. In the past, we have examined CMs on allegations of corruption by sending a team instead of calling them to Delhi," said a CBI official.  ... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
In line with Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's strategy to contain price rise in Congress-ruled states before the Lok Sabha elections, the Uttarakhand government has decided to keep fruits and vegetables out of the purview of Uttarakhand Agriculture Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act (UAPMA), 2011. A total of 93 agriculture produces (fruits and vegetables) were deleted from the notified list. This means no market levy will be charged on them.Chairman of Uttarakhand Agriculture Produce Marketing Board Shailendra Mohan Singhal said a notification was issued late on Monday night. "We will assess the impact of the decision on containing price rise," Singhal told The Indian Express. He evaded questions on revenue losses the board will incur following the decision. The board will lose Rs 8 to 9 crore per year because of the decision to exclude fruits and vegetables from UAPMA list. According to sources, the board's total income from mandies (wholesale markets) is around Rs 50 crore. Sources said the decision to exempt fruits and vegetables from market fees will not have a major impact on efforts to contain price rise. "It would hardly reduce prices of fruits and vegetables by two per cent. The mandies get about 2.5 per cent of the total price as market fee. Apart from this, the adhatis (commission agents) charge about 3 per cent from retailers or traders. It would be a difficult task for mandies to stop adhaties from charging commissions on purchases from farmers," a source said explaining problems the board would face after this decision. The decision is set to hit the plan to set up new mandies in hill areas. Two-thirds of Uttarakhand is hilly and mandies exist mainly in the plains. In the hills, there is little scope for foodgrain production. "The marketing board has initiated steps to set up mandies at least in seven places in hilly areas. At Karnaprayag, the mandy is in final shape," a source in the board said. According to him, the fund is raised from market fees the board earns. Mandies proposed to be set up in hilly areas have great scope for increasing business of fruits and vegetables, he added.
A Seven-day-old baby died of burn injuries due to overheating of the radiant warmer in the paediatrics ward of the Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital and Medical College here.Ishrat and Wasim, from Muzaffarnagar, had got their premature baby admitted to the hospital on December 28 on the reference of a nursing home at Shahpur tehsil where the baby was born. Doctors put the baby under the radiant warmer to help maintain body temperature. In the night, the doctors asked Wasim to take care of his baby as they moved to a nearby room for rest.Around 1.30 am, Wasim saw  smoke and called the doctors for help. But by the time the doctors turn off the overheated warmer, the baby had sustained 60 per cent burns. He was immediately shifted to the ICU where he died late Monday night. College principal Pradeep Bharti said, "The incident seems to have occurred due to short-circuit." He has formed a three-member committee to ascertain the cause of the death within three days. Bharti also blamed the lack of funds. "Machines here are old but we maintain them regularly. We cannot have new machines for paucity of funds and there is also a shortage of doctors and nurses to look after a heavy rush of patients in the hospital," he said.This is the second such incident. On April 24, a newborn baby died under the warmer at the hospital.
The Gujarat government on Tuesday granted Nanavati-Mehta Commission, that is probing the 2002 Godhra train carnage and subsequent communal riots in the state, extension till June 30, 2014 for submitting its report. Constituted on March 6, 2002 to probe the Godhra train carnage on February 27, 2002 and the subsequent communal riots in Gujarat, the Commission had sought "some more time" to submit its report. This is the 21st extension the Commission has got from the state government to complete its probe and submit a report. C G Patel, secretary of the Commission, said, "Today, we have received a communication through fax from the state government whereby the Commission has been granted extension till June 30, 2014." 
Irked by RJD president  Lalu Prasad's visit to riot relief camps in Muzaffarnagar, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav called the former Bihar chief minister a stooge of the Congress."Every other person is doing politics over Muzaffarnagar riots. After being released from prison, he (Lalu) went to Muzaffarnagar. He is engaged in sycophancy of Congress," Mulayam lashed out at Lalu while addressing party workers at an event organised to observe the death anniversary of socialist leader Raj Narain here on Tuesday.Imitating Lalu's style, Mulayam said: "He says 'Rahul Gandhi is my leader, Sonia Gandhi is my leader'. Jao Congress ki chaploosi karo... He says 'Mulayam will not be allowed to become PM'. Earlier, I was not allowed to become the PM. It is not a new thing, everybody knows you. You are licking the feet of Congress, lick it."Continuing his tirade against Lalu, Mulayam said the RJD leader may side with any party even the BJP. "But SP does not compromise on its ideals for gaining power," he added.Lalu had visited relief camps of riot victims in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday and blamed the SP government of Uttar Pradesh for the poor condition of the people residing there. He even had called up Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav asking him to make proper arrangements in the camps. Mulayam countered it by saying the state government has provided maximum relief, which is "unprecedented" in the country. "Minorities are unhappy with the Congress. We have given compensation, accused will be punished," he stated.The acrimony between Lalu and Mulayam dates back to 1997 when Lalu had allegedly scuttled Mulayam's chances of becoming the PM after the then prime minister H D Deve Gowda had resigned. Mulayam also claimed that he will soon visit Bihar "as people of Bihar want him to tour the state".... contd.
Initiating its first action in the multi-crore StockGuru scam, the Enforcement Directorate has issued attachment orders on properties worth Rs 83 crore of main accused Ullas Prabhakar Khaire and his wife under anti-money laundering laws.The seized properties, spread out across the country in Maharashtra, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana, include some 'benami' immovable assets that the couple had allegedly purchased on fake identities.The agency, sources said, will soon issue prohibitory orders on these assets, including cash, jewellery and bank accounts, under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).ED took the latest action after it recorded the statement of the duo, lodged in Tihar jail in judicial custody, and went through the probe reports of other agencies.The agency's action to attach these properties under PMLA is aimed at depriving the accused of the benefits of these assets, alleged to have been accumulated through the "proceeds of crime" by duping investors.
A day after BJP leader Arun Jaitley levelled allegations of corruption against him, Chief Minister  Virbhadra Singh rushed to Delhi Tuesday afternoon. The Himachal CM's unscheduled Delhi visit came amidst speculation about the Congress high command summoning him after the opposition's stiff demand for his ouster.On arrival in Delhi on Tuesday, the Himachal CM claimed that the allegations  were a "malicious campaign" by the Opposition. His wife, Pratibha Singh, who has also been accused of corruption, visited the AICC headquarters and met senior party leaders.While developments in the Congress show that the party leadership has been put in a tight spot over the charges, sources said Virbhadra may be given some time and asked to explain his position.Before flying to Delhi, Virbhadra is reported to have requisitioned files related to hydel projects including Saikothi (15 MW) project, which was allotted to Venture Energy and Technologies Ltd. Two Cabinet ministers, Sudhir Sharma (Urban and Housing) and Mukesh Agnihotri (Industry and Public relations), also accompanied Virbhadra to Delhi.Meanwhile, former Himachal CM and Leader of Opposition in the state Prem Kumar Dhumal maintained that if Virbhadra does not resign, the central and state BJP leadership will meet President Pranab Mukherjee and seek his removal.In a statement in the evening, Virbhadra refuted the allegations levelled by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Jaitley. "It is clarified that that Ispat Industry people have never met me except for once. I have never received any favour from them during my tenure as steel minister and neither any favour had been done to the firm during my period," he said.About his alleged favours to a certain power project, Virbhadra said it was the erstwhile BJP government that gave the project an extension. "On the other hand my government has taken a decision of cancelling the project thereby upholding the rule of law," he said.... contd.
Buoyed by victories in MP, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, it looks at 156 LS seats of UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka as key to 2014Firmly entrenched in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP  is looking at another set of three states that it believes holds the key to realising its Lok Sabha hopes for 2014."Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka are make or break for our 2014 dreams," stressed a BJP functionary considered close to prime ministerial candidate  Narendra Modi, speaking to The Indian Express days after the party won the assembly elections in the first three states.Not among the big targets is Bihar, which has 40 Lok Sabha seats and saw a bitter parting of ways with the JD(U). "Repeating or marginally bettering our tally without JD(U) support will be good enough, while larger gains will be a bonus," said the party leader. The BJP holds 12 seats out of the 15 it contested while in the alliance.In the states won, the BJP is banking on recent trends that have seen the party winning assembly polls frequently bagging most of that state's Lok Sabha seats, too. It is confident the leadership of Raman Singh, Shivraj Chouhan and Vasundhara Raje will take the burden off the central leadership.These three states account for only 65 Lok Sabha seats while UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka have 156. The BJP faces a Congress that has been holding its ground in Maharashtra and Karnataka and gained some in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha polls.Uttar PradeshIt is the obvious focus given its 80 seats. The BJP's first stint at power in New Delhi in 1996 had hinged on a robust performance in this state, though from 57 seats in 1998 (undivided UP) it slipped to 29 in 1999 following a rebellion by Kalyan Singh � who has since merged his party into the BJP. Close Modi aide Amit Shah, given charge of UP, has been consulting Kalyan on strategies to revive the party. Part of the strategy is nine mega rallies across regions by Modi, who has already held four and is slated to undertake three more and wind up in Lucknow before February-end when the actual campaign begins. Shah too has been touring the state and plans to visit at least 52 constituencies to put a setup in place. He has set the state organisation a target of 1.25 lakh booth committees.... contd.
As the CPI (Maoist) begins preparations to celebrate the 10th year of its formation, memories of the last 12 months will haunt its members. Though they launched their biggest ever assault on a political convoy this year, it included one of three major tactical blunders whose repercussions continue to undermine their ideological highland. They also found their fighting prowess seriously questioned as they lost as many as 50 cadres in only six gunbattles dominated by security forces or splinter groups of their own former cadres, who lost only one member to the Maoists. The killings of PCC chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel in the Darbha attack, and the separate murders of journalists Nemichand Jain and Sai Reddy in Bastar, have brought them widespread flak, even from their sympathisers. These were the first instances Maoists had killed journalists. The rebels had to apologise for Jain's murder saying it had been committed by their lower cadres, and admit that the killing of the Patels too was a mistake. Bastar journalists unanimously boycotted Maoists, while the People's Union for Democratic Rights' secretaries referred to the CPI (Maoist) constitution, a document considered sacrosanct by the rebels, and noted, "The two killings (of journalists) were carried out by the Maoists without even complying with the provisions of their own constitution. This raises a question if they take their own constitution seriously."In the two months preceding the May 25 Darbha attack, when the Maoists killed 27 persons including the Congress leaders, the organisation suffered huge losses in quick succession across its various zones. A Jharkhand-based ultra-Left outfit, Triteeya Sammelan Prastuti Committee, killed 10 Maoists in Chatra on March 28; the Gadchiroli police killed nine Maoists in two encounters in April; a joint team of Andhra Greyhounds, Chhattisgarh police and CRPF killed nine Maoists in Sukma the same month.  In July, the Gadchiroli police killed six women Maoists; in September, the Malkangiri cops killed 14 Maoists. ... contd.
Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari  Tuesday refuted reports of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's imminent resignation. He also added that Rahul Gandhi is the "natural leader" of the Congress."This (reports of PM's resignation) is baseless and without facts. I don't want to lend decorum to such questions by reacting to them. Rahul Gandhi is the natural leader of the Congress party, but as the UPA chairperson has said, if required we will declare a PM candidate in time," Tewari said. His remarks came a day after Congress leader and Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the party should declare its PM candidate.Tewari was speaking at the launch of the Directorate of Advertising & Visual Publicity's calendar for 2014. The calendar highlights the achievements of the UPA government, such as MGNREGA, Food Security Aadhaar, etc.Tewari conceded that the results of the recent Assembly elections had disappointed the Congress, but the party was ready to take on the 2014 "challenge"."To some extent, people seemed to be overawed by the results of the Assembly elections. Yes, for us as a party, maybe as a government they have been disappointing. But if you look at them in perspective, out of 29 states that went to polls in the past five years, the Congress won twelve," he said.Tewari also objected to the use of the phrase 'secular tourism', used by the BJP to describe Rahul's visit to Muzaffarnagar, and said it reflects a "narrow mindset".
Congress state president Ramesh Chennithala would join the Oommen Chandy government on Wednesday in a pre-poll bid to indulge the upper class Hindu Nair community. Chennithala, a Nair, is slated to get Home, replacing Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, a Nair close to Chandy.Chennithala's cabinet entry has been in the air for several months but a decision was delayed as he was reluctant to accept any portfolio other than the home department. Chandy refused to part with home, held by his loyalist. Now, as the second-in-command in the cabinet, Chennithala would be breathing down his rival Chandy's neck. "Chennithala's cabinet entry has pending. Last week, the high command gave the final go-ahead. The party high command would decide who should become the state president," said Chandy.Nair Service Society, the outfit of Nair community, welcomed the decision with its general secretary Sukumaran Nair saying that an upper class Hindu in a key position in the government would augur well for the Congress. The NSS had insisted that Chennithala should be made a key figure in the government. It was not happy with Radhakrishnan holding Home despite he being a Nair too.Chennithala, who had repeatedly stated that the post of the party chief was several notches above that of a minister, on Tuesday turned a humble party worker. "I have never been after power. I'm just obeying the directives of party president Sonia Gandhi," he said.Indicating that Radhakrishnan would be retained in the cabinet, Chandy said, "Nobody from the cabinet is going out." Radhakrishnan is likely to get either sports or forest departments, now held by Chandy after K B Ganesh Kumar resigned following cases related to domestic issues.However, the bid to woo the Nair community has spelled fresh trouble for the UDF. Kerala Congress (B) chairman R Balakrishna Pillai, a director of NSS, said his son Kumar should be taken back as the minister. ... contd.
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said on Tuesday that while the "general impression" about BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is that he is "divisive", a section of people feels that he will be able to take "certain tough decisions... maybe positive ones" (on the Kashmir issue)."Modi has a mixed response (in the Valley). Some people don't like him, mainly because J&K is a Muslim majority state � not that there haven't been communal riots before Gujarat. Riots have taken place before Gujarat riots and after that too � in Assam and more recently in Muzaffarnagar. But when it comes to Gujarat, people saw the pictures and can't forget them," she said, speaking at the Idea Exchange programme at The Indian Express."But there is another section of people which probably thinks that maybe Modi is the one who will have such authority that he will be able to take certain tough decisions (regarding Kashmir issue). Decisions like Vajpayee took. Otherwise no other prime minister has ever taken any tough decision. When militancy was at its peak, he (Vajpayee) went to Lahore on the bus yatra. The same day, seven Hindu boys were killed... Even after Kargil, he invited the Pakistan President. And then Parliament (attack) happened," recalled Mufti."I think people have this impression that if Modi comes, he may be able to take certain tough decisions, maybe positive ones, because he did say at a rally in Jammu that he was going to follow Vajpayee's policies. But this impression is not shared by everybody, just a section. The general impression is that he is divisive," she said.On the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Mufti said, "Even the Kashmir Valley is celebrating this change of people who are not conventional politicians winning. Basically, in the Valley, the mainstream national parties are seen as untouchable because, firstly, they are seen as bad, and secondly, they are seen as being connected to Delhi. So, I think this example of AAP may make people change their mind... People may start believing that it (politics) is not so bad, it can have a positive impact too."... contd.
A special Goa court Tuesday acquitted all six accused in the 2009 Diwali eve bomb blast case in Margao town. Special court judge Pradip Sawaikar acquitted all the accused for lack of evidence against them. Two of the other accused who were ferrying the explosives to a crowded spot where the low intensity blast occurred, were the only ones killed in the explosion. The accused � Vinay Talekar, Dhananjay Ashtekar, Prashant Ashtekar, Vinayak Patil, Prashant Juvekar and Dilip Mazgaonkar � were arrested by Goa crime branch. 
A small aircraft Tuesday made an emergency landing on National Highway 69 near Betul and took off from the same place a couple of hours later. Amused bystanders and motorists had to wait as traffic was halted to facilitate the early morning landing.Sam Varma, a businessman who owns the Cessna aircraft, claimed the pilot was left with no other option because the tall light masts erected on the highway made it difficult for him to land the four-seater on the private airstrip located just off the highway.But the district administration did not buy the explanation and suggested that the emergency landing was an attempt to highlight the businessman's grouse against the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Varma has been complaining about the tall masts since October when they first came up.The DGCA has started an inquiry into the incident, while the district administration has asked for a detailed report from Varma. Besides the pilot, Jaboc, there was one more passenger in the plane.Varma, himself a pilot, told The Indian Express that since October, planes have had to take off and land in only one direction to avoid the tall masts, but the high tailwinds on Tuesday made that impossible. He said he had informed the NHAI about restrictions on tall structures near the airstrip, but they did not yield. He said he had filed an FIR against the Nagpur-based NHAI project director for putting lives at risk.Betul collector Rajesh Mishra said he was waiting for a detailed report from Varma.Varma said the pilot had taken permission from ATC, Mumbai, before taking off. He said the pilot spoke to him over radio and discussed the possibility of landing in a nearby dam in a bid to avoid casualties on ground. Varma said he suggested the highway and spoke to police authorities who cooperated by stopping traffic.... contd.
Veteran fighter pilot Arup Raha Tuesday took over as the 24th chief of the Indian Air Force, succeeding Air Chief Marshal N A K Browne. In a brief ceremony, Raha, 59, assumed charge of the IAF from Browne in the presence of senior officers, including new Vice Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal R K Sharma and Deputy Chief Air Marshal S Sukumar.Raha, who was born on December 26, 1954, will remain the IAF chief for three years.Raha, in his message to the 1.75 lakh-strong force, said the IAF is on a trajectory of modernisation and is transforming into a strategic aerospace power with full spectrum capability.
A day after fulfilling his promise to supply free water, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday kept his word to slash electricity prices in the national capital and audit the private power distribution companies. Following a meeting of the Delhi Cabinet, Kejriwal announced the government would provide a 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units a month. "As promised the AAP government  has slashed 50 per cent of the rates by giving a subsidy on the tariff. This will impact at least 28 lakh households in Delhi. Economically weaker sections of society will benefit from this decision," Kejriwal said.The subsidy is expected to cost the state Rs 200 crore per quarter until the end of the financial year in March. However, Kejriwal said it would cost Rs 61 crore. "Rs 61 crore will be given to Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited. But the remaining Rs 139 crore approximately will be given to government companies that are providing services and supply power to BSES Yamuna Private Limited and BSES Rajdhani Private Limited. And it will be adjusted from the accounts of BSES companies as they are yet to pay dues worth Rs 4,500 crore," the new chief minister said.Asked whether the government could give a subsidy when a regulator is in place, Kejriwal said: "The government has powers to give subsidy." Both discoms refused to comment on the subsidy when reached for their view. Kejriwal also announced a CAG audit into the finances of the three private power distribution companies. "The discoms have 24 hours to submit their objections on government views on the proposal for audit of their finances," he said. Kejriwal met CAG officials before chairing the Cabinet meeting and said the government auditor had in principle agreed to conduct the audit.... contd.
Proprietors of the first marijuana retailers licensed to sell pot for recreational use in Colorado were busy rolling joints and stocking up their leafy merchandise ahead of a grand opening on Wednesday that marks a new chapter in America's drug culture.Thirteen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers who are interested in nothing more than its mind- and mood-altering properties were slated to begin welcoming customers as early as 8 a.m. local time.When they do, they will be launching an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross $578 million in annual revenues, including $67 million in tax receipts for the state.Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters.But starting New Year's Day, cannabis will be legally produced, sold to the general public and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of Colorado.Due to the novelty factor, operators of the first group of retailers slated to open their doors in the Denver area and a handful of other locations were anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed.Inside a warehouse tucked away in the blue-collar Denver suburb of Northglenn, a trio of workers were feverishly rolling hundreds of marijuana cigarettes by hand in preparation for the onslaught."We expect to have 2,000 joints ready to go by the time we open," said Robin Hackett, 51, co-owner of Botana Care, who said she expects between 800 to 1,000 customers to patronize her store the first day.The store has hired a private security firm to help with traffic and parking issues that might arise.... contd.
A woman was allegedly stabbed and set on fire by a group of men, including a village sarpanch, in Ganjam district of Orissa on Monday evening. She succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday. Pranati Das (30), an owner of a public distribution system (PDS) shop, was at home in Sanaramchandrapur village in Rambha area of Ganjam on Monday when she was called out by two men. When she came out, "five people, including the sarpanch of the Sanaramchandrapur grampanchayat, stabbed her with a sword, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire," Ganjam SP Ashish Kumar Singh said. "She had shut her shop by 7 pm. There was a power-cut in the area and people were in their homes when the incident happened," he said.Das, who lived alone, was taken to MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town with more than 95 per cent burn injuries. As her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to a hospital in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh where she succumbed to her injuries Tuesday morning.The SP said the woman had, in her dying statement, accused the sarpanch of trying to get ownership of her shop. "There clearly was lot of  bad blood between the two. From her house, we recovered a couple of threatening letters from him (the sarpanch), asking her to to give up the dealership of the shop.""It would have been difficult for us to nab the accused had the woman not revealed their names in her dying statement. We have arrested four of the 5 accused. The case would be put up for fast-track trial," he said.
A 15-year-old youth, who was detained on Sunday for his alleged involvement in the twin terror attacks  in Hiranagar and Samba on September 26, had crossed over to India two-and-a-half years back, according to BSF officials."It is highly unlikely that he would have been involved in such a big terror attacks. He was going back to Pakistan as he was fed up with his life here. He told us that he had fled his country to escape penury, but he had to work here and was not given full meals," said Dharminder Pareek, DIG, BSF, Jammu. The youth, according to officials, was a fan of Bollywood films and wanted to become a hero."He says he crossed over to India when he was a little over 12 years old. It is unlikely that he would have been sent by his handlers more than two years ago to plot the attack," said another official. Another official said when they caught the youth, they did not find any cellphone or money on him, and he was wearing torn clothes. After preliminary interrogation, the BSF handed him over to Kathua police. Kathua SP Mohan Lal said, "Interrogation is still on." The police have obtained 10 days' remand and the youth will be interrogated by a joint team from the Intelligence Bureau, state police and BSF.A BSF official said the youth was working for a Gurjjar family at Hariyachak in Kathua. The Gurjjar, identified as Hassan Din, has been arrested for keeping the youth illegally with him. The youth, who is reported to be from Sahiwal district in Pakistan's Punjab, has reportedly told interrogators that he was not given any salary. He was reportedly on his way back to Pakistan when he was detained by a BSF team.... contd.
The output of eight key infrastructure industries bounced back 1.7 per cent in November, primarily due to better performance of cement and electricity generation. This might signal a reversal of the downturn.The output of the core sector comprising crude oil, coal, natural gas, fertilisers, steel, cement, electricity and refinery products had contracted in October.The data released by the government on Tuesday showed that the cumulative growth in these industries during the April-November period stood at 2.5 per cent compared to 6.7 per cent during the same period a year ago.This group has a weight of 37.90 per cent in the index of industrial production (IIP),  the gauge of industrial activity in the country. It had fallen 0.6 per cent in October.Electricity generation, witnessed an increase of 5.9 per cent as against 1.3 per cent in October and 2.4 per cent in November last year. Cement production expanded 4.2 per cent during the month compared to a one per cent growth in October and a contraction of 0.2 per cent year-on-year.Economists have interpreted the number has a revival in industrial activity, but cautioned that it is likely to remain mild going forward."It will have some impact on IIP. We expect mild growth to continue in the second half, indicating some kind of industrial revival but there should not be expectation of a stellar recovery," DK Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research, said. IIP data for November will be released on January 12. Index for industrial production contracted 1.8 per cent in October 2013 while it remained flat during the April-October period. Production of coal, crude oil and steel also showed some growth during the month. Coal production grew 2.3 per cent compared to a contraction of 3.9 per cent in October and a contraction of 2.9 per cent year-on-year. ... contd.
On Monday night, when the temperature dropped to near zero in Muzaffarnagar district   and rain added to the chill, the district administration informed 300 families living out in the open for the last four months that they had 24 hours to pack up and leave.In adjoining Shamli, where riot refugees have been huddling in 12 relief camps, district authorities told community leaders "hosting" them that they had until January 4 to empty out the camps completely.Consequently, over Monday and Tuesday, 483 families piled their children and belongings together on 30-odd government tempos and trucks and left, pulling their buffaloes and goats alongside. Some 2,000 of those who left had fled from Fugana village, where the largest number of riot FIRs were registered, including six of gangrape.Some of them headed to the wet, muddy pieces of open land they have purchased in Loi or Neem Kheda with the Rs 5-lakh compensation the government has given them; others sought out a small bit of courtyard or a verandah in the home of a generous benefactor in Loi.Still others went in search of shelter in two rooms at a government school in Muzaffarnagar, or in the cluster of 70-odd houses that the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind is building in Khampur.On Tuesday, many of these families sat huddled at the bus stand in Neem Kheda, apparently with nowhere else to go. A few of the men struggled to erect cloth or plastic sheets above their heads; others simply sat or lay exhausted on charpais in the open, getting gently soaked in the fine rain that fell."Jab rakshak bhakshak ban jaye toh kya hoga? This time not only the state authorities but also the village pradhan turned against us. They said paperwork for the compensation could continue, but we needed to get off land owned by the government, and to protect ourselves from the cold. How are we being protected from the cold here?" said 23-year-old Afsana, as she pulled some donated woollens on her children Kashish, 2, and Sahir, 4.... contd.
In 2013, India failed to manage important bilateral relationships, or to communicate the rationale of foreign policy initiatives.Was 2013 the annus horribilis for Indian foreign policy? Foreign policy formulation and implementation by definition require meticulous planning, attention to detail and clinical and mature assessments. Some of these qualities were not in full evidence during the course of the year. The events of 2013 provide pointers to a few trends. First, the management of the more important bilateral relationships, particularly those in our immediate neighbourhood and with the United States, requires extra effort and skilful handling not only with the countries concerned but also with domestic constituencies, including the media and state governments. The required margin of persuasion with domestic constituents does not appear to have been used in 2013. In many cases, there was a failure to communicate the rationale of policy initiatives, even when these were sound. The management of our relations with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is a case in point. In the case of the former, the failure to persuade domestic constituencies, particularly the chief minister of West Bengal, will prove to be costly, in both the short and medium terms. In Sri Lanka's case, we failed to encourage Colombo to move away from majoritarianism and be more responsive to and ensure Tamil interests.With Pakistan, the year started badly. The barbaric beheading of an Indian soldier inside Indian territory in January, the murder of Sarabjit Singh in a Pakistani prison in April-May and the killing of five Indian soldiers by Pakistani special forces in August brought relations to a boil. Firing along the Line of Control almost threatened the 10-year-old ceasefire. Domestic passions were inflamed and provided just the opportunity some members of our strategic community required to indulge in Pakistan-bashing. There was little or no evidence that the new political dispensation in Pakistan either wished to turn a new leaf  or had the clout to rein in the terror machine. The need to keep channels of communication open is not an issue. What was and should continue to be the decisive determinant is timing. The prime minister should have been discouraged from meeting his counterpart in New York. Strong political opposition domestically, particularly from the BJP, scaled down expectations.... contd.
The Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) is likely to take up three hydro power projects at its next meeting. These projects have been held up on account of environmental and forest clearances.The three hydel projects � Tawang (800 MW) and Tato (700 MW) and Teesta (520 MW) � have been awaiting environmental clearances for a very long time."These projects in Arunachal Pradesh (Tawang and Tato) and (Teesta) Sikkim have been sent to CCI from the power ministry for clearance," said a source. He said the CCI may take up the proposals at its next meeting but did not specify a date for that.Teesta Stage-IV Hydroelectric Project is a run of the river scheme proposed along river Teesta. The project was awarded to NHPC in 2009. At that time the estimated project cost was Rs 3,594.74 crore.The project, which is likely to supply electricity to Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand, was expected to be commissioned in 2012.The Tawang Hydroelectric Project is proposed on Tawangchu river. The estimated project cost at the time of award was Rs 6,112.30 crore. The 700 MW Tata hydro power project in Arunchal Pradesh is being set up by Tato Hydro Power Private Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Power.
Syed Ata HusnainOn India-Pakistan, the good news is that the armies are talking.It is good to see the trust reposed in the director-general of military operations (DGMO) to stabilise, if not resolve, a tricky military-to-military relationship, which more often than not transforms into a tricky nation-to-nation relationship. But what do such meetings really achieve, and how should they be handled? This time around, it's been all about the Line of Control (LoC) and the frequent flare-ups which threaten to trigger greater tension with Pakistan.The DGMO meeting is not a flag meeting. Flag meetings are at the level of local commanders or staff. They take place on either side of the LoC or border, as the case may be. They are not part of the political dialogue but are just border conferences to temporarily dilute a military standoff in a situation where political parleys are not possible. Unlike a political dialogue, it does not take much effort to organise a flag meeting. Sometimes, they can be held for a specific purpose, not linked to the LoC or to border tension. However, the usual flag meetings at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and LoC are held to de-escalate a crisis situation. A flag meeting between general officers is rare � it remains pegged at the level of colonel or brigadier to keep the agenda local. It does not resolve an issue and neither should it be expected to � unless it is to hand over or take back someone who has unwittingly crossed the LoC. This is because the agenda is usually contentious and the participants are not empowered to dilute the established positions. There have been times when firing has recommenced in the vicinity of a flag meeting, even as the local commanders returned to their respective sides after the meeting. Lasting solutions to even local problems are almost impossible.... contd.
Ruchira GuptaAn open letter to Indian women, a year after December 16, 2012.Dear Sisters,Congratulations. You've survived this far. You have forged a large and diverse movement in 2013 that has resulted in a stricter law against male sexual assault and made visible women's oppression at home and in the workplace. You have broken the silence against your oppressor, even though they were your friends, colleagues, brothers, and fathers. You have found the courage to overcome your so-called shame and stigma and finally shifted the blame to your abusers � in Goa, Gujarat, Delhi, Maharashtra and West Bengal.You have survived being called a man-hater, a family-breaker, revengeful, frigid, shrill, divisive, ugly, and "not feminine." You've paid the personal price, when you confronted your father for assaulting your friend, or your boss for assaulting you. You've survived men yelling, "This law is too strict, women are falsely accusing us." You have survived bitterness, when your abuser got off scot-free and you were told you seduced him by wearing the wrong clothes. You have survived guilt for not being a "good" mother or "good" wife. You have succeeded in facing off a conservative backlash from a society that wanted you to stay indoors after dark, wear certain clothes, behave in a certain way and not give you jobs because you were female. You have shown those who said they would fear hiring you as their secretary, that you would now be the Boss looking for a secretary � male or female.You've endured despair, when only the failures felt real � when the numbers of repeated and continued rape seemed unrelenting and when feminist victories got conveniently dissociated from feminism � when some people declared that over the past 30 years, the Women's Movement "didn't care about" class, caste, homophobia, the environment, men, or that the women's movement was different from other movements against inequality.... contd.
In her first public statement in the two-week-old India-US spat over the treatment of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York, the US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell Tuesday said she regretted the circumstances of Khobragade's arrest even as officials in America indicated charges against the IFS officer would not be withdrawn.Powell's statement, which was weaved into her new year's message, was seen as an attempt to assuage India's concerns as the furore over the alleged mistreatment of Khobragade has soured relations.New Delhi responded by saying it would communicate with Washington through the designated channel, the State Department in this case, and that it remained serious about pursuing misuse of diplomatic privileges by US diplomats in India."I join Secretary Kerry in expressing our regret for the circumstances of the consular officer's arrest, but we believe that we can look forward to continuing to expand our bilateral relations," Powell said in her message, referring to a similar expression of regret by Secretary of State John Kerry in the days after the row erupted.Referring to various "impressive developments" between India and the US in a wide-range of areas, she said this "forward movement has been jolted by very different reactions to issues involving one of your consular officers and her domestic worker".Senior US officials in New York had late on Monday rejected India's contention that salary details in the visa application of Khobragade's domestic help had been misconstrued and asserted there is "no goof up" and that the case against her is on a firm footing.The officials said the visa fraud charges against Khobragade will not be dropped as "the strength of the fraud in the case is very strong"."The case will be there against her, it will not be dropped. The charges will remain," the sources said, adding that if the 39-year-old diplomat gets full diplomatic immunity, she can travel outside the country. ... contd.
India's external debt declined by $9 billion to $400.3 billion at the end of September 2013 with government debt component at $77.3 billion."At end-September 2013, India's total external debt stock stood at $400.3 billion, recording a decline of $ 9 million over the level at end-March 2013," said a finance ministry release. Of this, the long-term debt was $305.5 billion at the end of September, showing an increase of 0.6 per cent over March 31 level, while short-term debt declined by 2 per cent to $ 94.8 billion. "Government (Sovereign) external debt stood at $ 77.3 billion, (19.3 per cent of total external debt) at end September 2013 vis-a-vis $81.7 billion (20.4 per cent) at end-March 2013," the ministry further said.The share of US dollar-denominated debt continued to be the highest in external debt stock at 60.7 per cent at end-September 2013, followed by the Indian rupee (20.9 per cent), Special Drawing Rights (7.6 per cent), Japanese Yen (5.7 per cent), and Euro (3.2 per cent).India's foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 69.3 per cent to the total external debt stock at end-September 2013 as against 73.0 per cent at end-March 2013, the ministry said.
A 35 year old Nepalese man has been arrested for tattooing the likeness of his friend's wife on his chest, the first case of its kind in the country.Kumar Kesi from Kavre district east of Kathmandu claimed that his love had grown after he tattooed the woman's picture on his chest."Kumar has been kept in police custody under the Public Offence Act as there is no law related to the act of tattooing a woman's picture," police officer Arun Kumar Bisi said.According to police, the case is the first of its kind in the country.Kumar said he fell in love with the woman after she was introduced to him by her husband four years ago. "We began to love each other after our meetings," he claimed.Kumar had used a photo given to him by the woman some years ago for the tattoo, which features the woman with her hair tied and a big 'tika' on her forehead.After he showed off the tattoo to his friends during Diwali last year, word about it spread like wildfire.He said: "She used to meet me in Banepa and Kathmandu on the pretext that she was ill, and had to go for check up."Kumar and the woman's husband were dump truck drivers at a local industry.The husband forced his wife to disclose their relationship and filed a case against Kumar. Following the complaint, police arrested Kumar recently.15 Indian-origin men, women on Queen's Honours listLondon: Fifteen Indian-origin men and women, including prominent educationist Asha Khemka, have been named in Queen Elizabeth's New Year's Honours List for 2014.Khemka has been named a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her service to the deprived areas of the West Midlands as principal of West Nottinghamshire College for the last eight years. "Under her leadership, it has become one of the most eminent further education colleges in the UK. She has embraced the apprenticeship agenda, leading the college to become the largest 16-18 provider in the UK and finding jobs for 700 young people in the first year," read a special citation accompanying the higher awards in this year's list.

Seven years after the suicide spiral in Vidarbha's six cotton-growing districts touched a record 1,449 in 2006, here's something to celebrate the new year with: the number of deaths fell to about half that number in 2013.The year gone by recorded only 752 suicides , although that number could rise by a few due to some late reporting. It also reflects a markedly improving suicide-to-population ratio considering the significant growth in population in these seven years.The 2013 number has to be seen in relation to that of 2006 since meticulous reporting of all suicides � farmers and non-farmers � in the countryside began that year.The overall figures, generally reported as farmers' suicides, actually include suicides by men, young girls and boys and housewives from farmer and non-farmer households although suicides in farmer households are much higher.The Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, which maintains its own suicide-count, has recorded 824 suicides for 2013 from all 11 districts of the region, including the five that grow paddy.The record low in the number of suicides comes in a year that saw unprecedented havoc caused by rains in the region, killing hundreds of people and thousands of cattle and hurting farming in over 15 lakh hectares.The turnaround in the six cotton and soyabean producing districts of Wardha, Yavatmal, Amravati, Akola, Washim and Buldana, has coincided with concerted government interventions through the chief minister's and Prime Minister's packages - often dubbed failures - as also with the massive spread of Bt cotton, which now covers more than 95 per cent of the region's cotton area and which activists have been blaming for an "increase" in suicides. Almost all these districts have registered the drop consistently from 2006, barring 2010 which saw an increase. The drop has been most significant in Buldana (305 to 120) and Washim (185 to 56), two of the most backward districts of the region. In Amravati, it has gone down to 159 from 270 and in Wardha to 79 from 143. Yavatmal, which routinely registered the highest number of suicides, marked a drop to 219 from 359.... contd.
A fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami leader was Tuesday killed in Bangladesh in a clash with security forces as the opposition geared up for a non-stop nationwide blockade from the New Year to derail the January 5 polls.Police said local Jamaat leader Abdul Jabbar was killed in a clash between the opposition activists and joint forces, comprising paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and police, in western Meherpur district, bordering India."The members of the law enforcement agencies were injured in the gunfight," a police official told a TV channel.In the capital Dhaka, BNP activists took out processions and exploded bombs in old part of the city as it called for a nationwide protest Tuesday.The main opposition BNP led by Khaleda Zia Monday night called for the nationwide blockade of roads, railways and waterways after it was barred for the second consecutive day from staging the "march for democracy" in the capital.The BNP-led 18-party alliance has been demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and scrapping of the polls.BNP Chairperson's Advisor Khandker Mahbub Hossain said the non-stop nationwide blockade starting from January 1 would continue until further announcement.He asked opposition activists to stage "peaceful" protest rallies across the country Tuesday as a warm-up exercise.The opposition has dubbed the polls as "farcical" as over half of the candidates in the 300-seat parliament were set to be declared unopposed in the absence of rival contenders from the opposition.The alliance earlier enforced identical blockades for nearly a month from November 26 after the Election Commission declared the schedule for the polls amid stalemate over the nature of poll-time government.
Despite its commitment to meet the target for 2013-14, the Centre's fiscal health deteriorated further in November with the fiscal deficit shooting to 93.9 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE) as tax collections and disinvestment proceeds fell short of target.Even more worryingly, both the revenue and primary deficits has exceeded the Budget projections at 103.5 per cent and 171.8 per cent of the BE  respectively between April and November 2013.Data released by the Controller General of Accounts revealed that the the Centre's fiscal deficit stood at Rs 5,09,557 crore or 93.9 per cent of the BE of Rs 5,42,499 crore between April and November. It was significantly lower at Rs 4,12,926 crore a year ago.Finance minister P Chidambaram has called the target of 4.8 per cent, a "red line" that will not be breached. The target is also being monitored by global rating agencies who have warned that any fiscal slippage could lead to a rating downgrade for India."Fiscal consolidation in the past has been driven by growth in revenue but this year, revenue receipts are not as plentiful. We expect the fiscal deficit at 5.1 to 5.2 per cent in 2013-14 but this could be lower depending on the quantum of expenditure compression by the government," said DK Pant, chief economist at India Ratings. But flagging tax receipts that amounted to Rs 3,96,166 crore or just 45 per cent of the BE of Rs 8,84,078 crore could pose a challenge. Finance ministry officials said that indirect tax collections may fall short of target by Rs 41,000 crore. But an improvement is expected in direct tax receipts in December with advance tax payments.
With high inflation eating into workers' savings, trade union leaders who dominate decision making at the Employee's Provident Fund Organisation have demanded a 9 per cent  return on retirement savings for FY14 even as the organisation wants to continue with 8.5 per cent. The issue will be taken up when the EPFO's apex decision making body � the Central Board of Trustees meets on January 13, after a gap of 11 months. "With high inflation and high interest rates, the government should also offer a higher return on PF deposits," said AK Padmanabhan, member, CBT and president, Centre of Indian Trade Unions. "There has to be some increase in PF rates to protect the value of the workers' savings," says another leader. In last fiscal year, the EPFO offered an 8.5 per cent return on the provident fund deposits of workers in the private organised sector.  In 2013-14, the EPFO is estimated to have earned Rs 20,796.96 crore of which Rs 20,740 crore will be used to pay 8.5 per cent interest to its subscribers.An 8.5 per cent interest would leave the retirement fund manager with just about Rs 57 crore surplus in 2013-14 while even a 50 basis point hike would require an additional Rs 1,000 crore in the fiscal."We would have liked to pay a higher interest rate to subscribers who are already reeling from high inflation but it has to be in proportion with our returns," said a senior EPFO official. Apart from the interest rate, the Trustees in the first such meeting this fiscal, are also expected to take up a host of proposals including a revamped investment pattern for the EPF. The new pattern, which is based on the finance ministry's investment pattern for pension and provident fund trusts, 2008, envisages raising the cap on investments in PSU and private sector corporate bonds to 55 per cent but has refrained from investing in equities.... contd.
*  This refers to 'Kejriwal govt opens freebie floodgates: 667 litres daily' (IE, December 31). Arvind Kejriwal is quite lucky since, unlike Mamata Banerjee who took over the reins from the ossified Left Front government in West Bengal, he has inherited a cash-rich administration from former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. But he is also unlucky as the Delhi government has to coordinate quite a bit with the Centre. It is imperative that Kejriwal use public money judiciously. The aam aadmi has many needs that are still to be met. The granting of 667 litres of free water per day to households will only benefit people with piped water connections and water meters. Kejriwal must prioritise reaching out to that section of Delhi's population which has no water meters to begin with. He should aim to provide piped water to everyone.� B.N. AnandMohali*  Why is the AAP providing free water to people who who can afford to pay for it? Meanwhile, millions of people without piped water connections will continue to wait for the water tankers. The culture of freebies may win some votes but it will be economically and socially disastrous.� P.L. DharDelhiUnsung hero*  This refers to the editorial 'King Kallis' (IE, December 31). There is no doubt that Jacques Kallis is one of South African cricket's unsung heroes. As is Rahul Dravid in India and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the West Indies. If we compare Kallis's performance statistics with those of iconic players like Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar, he is definitely a notch ahead of them. It would be futile to compare Kallis with the legendary Garry Sobers � the times during which they played were too different. Sobers was the best all-rounder of his era. But if you compare Kallis to acclaimed all-rounders of the recent past � Ian Botham, Imran Khan, Richard Hadlee and our very own Kapil Dev � there is no doubt that Kallis is king.... contd.
STEVEN LEE MYERSTwin terrorist attacks in the city of Volgograd within 24 hours injected new urgency Monday into Russia's long, ruthless effort to contain a diffuse Islamic insurgency on its southern border, one nominally led by a veteran, battle-scarred Chechen called Russia's Osama bin Laden.The attacks, coming only six weeks before the opening of the Olympics just 400 miles away, sowed widespread fear across the country.The investigation into the bombings is just getting underway, but the attention of the Russian security services is already focused on the republic of Dagestan, which has become the hub of Muslim separatist violence in recent years, and on connections to the insurgent leader, Doku Umarov. He is a mysterious, almost mythical figure who fought in both Chechnya wars, which began nearly two decades ago and have come to symbolize the radicalization of a movement that began as a struggle for independence.Umarov's influence had seemed to be waning in recent years, until he surfaced in a video in July, ordering his followers to do whatever was possible to attack Russia as it prepared to be the host of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Volgograd, Umarov's threats, largely ignored at the time, suddenly seemed ominous, chillingly citing Russia's transportation networks as potential targets.Now, experts say, the question is whether the suicide bombings in Volgograd and one previous attack there are the first volleys in Umarov's promised campaign to disrupt the Olympic Games and discredit the government of President Vladimir V Putin."The big question is will there be this sort of wave," said Gordon M Hahn, a senior associate with the Centre of Strategic and International Studies. "This is already a pretty high level - the fact that they pulled off three suicide bombings in Volgograd in two months. If their idea is to build up a crescendo, they have to take it easy because they'll have to do something really big."... contd.
The last year showed an India that is striving to reimagine itself � and where it is failing to.For India to look ahead, it must look again at Muzaffarnagar. Thousands of men, women and children who fled their homes after the communal violence in September to huddle in the cold in relief camps, are being urged by the administration to go back to the villages where their attackers still roam mostly free and unpunished. A government that failed to protect them from violence, which then sought to brazenly deny their suffering, is now abdicating its responsibility to provide them the sense of security, opportunity and space they desperately need to rebuild their lives. The desolate relief camps are a reproach to all the heady claims made for a new India's politics � that it is leaving behind its old divides and hatreds, that it is becoming younger and more forward looking, that governments are being coaxed to become more accountable because of more demanding citizens and an increasingly activist media and judiciary. The responsibility for the Muzaffarnagar shame must be owned by a government that is avowedly "secular", headed by a chief minister who was seen to signal a generational shift in his party and whose electoral victory was widely read as a vote for a more modern and development-oriented politics and government in Uttar Pradesh.Yet, as we step into 2014, something has changed, too. For one, the last year showed us that violence against women, for long a crime with no name, could be an issue that brings people out to the streets, to express outrage and demand justice. The brutal gangrape of a young woman in Delhi in December 2012 led to mass protests and eventually a change in law. The law is imperfect, informed by more impatience than deliberation, but it underlines that women's safety has assumed its rightful place as a mainstream, public issue. It will no longer be relegated. A similar urgency was vested in another old issue last year. Corruption became the plank that propelled a campaign's transformation into a political party and then the party of government, all in the space of a year. On corruption, as on sexual violence, for now the solutions are informed by more righteousness and rage than rigour. But there is hope that the complacence and cynicism about politics-as-usual is being pierced, and that this will lead to something better.... contd.
A new democratic experimentalism is in the air.India's great churning will continue in the coming year. There is new momentum towards change. The momentum will be most manifest in glimpses of a new institutional order that is coming into being. India's progressive moment is now beginning to find its feet, with a clamour for a governance architecture that is more horizontal, transparent, decentralised, based on public reason and allows for new political formations to emerge. This process will continue. The flotsam of the old order will continue to be visible, and will often disguise the new undercurrents forming. More poison may come out of the system as partisan competition intensifies. But amid all the high-decibel exchanges, a quiet revolution will continue. But the revolution will be most palpable in a subtle reorientation of attitudes. The most besetting sin of Indian democracy over the last couple of years has been its corrosive cynicism. It was a cynical democracy with much to be cynical about. But the cynicism had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Few believed anything could change, so little changed. There were no texts, there were only subtexts. Virtue was nothing but deception. We converted it into such an art form that there was cynicism about everything that pretended to be anything other than cynicism. The cynicism was compounded by what Amartya Sen has made India's badge of self-identification: the argumentative Indian. We thought arguing was generally a good thing, since it denoted a kind of freedom and engagement with learning. But we forgot the other side. An argumentative person is someone who goes on arguing, well after the matter has been settled. Much of our public argument had this character. It was not argument in the interest of learning; it was argument in the interest of going on and on. Few who came to the argument were open to being persuaded, few were open to any possibilities other than what they had already committed to.... contd.
Gold was steady in thin year-end trade on Tuesday on course for its biggest annual decline in 32 years as prospects for global economic recovery prompted investors to switch to riskier assets.After a 12-year bull run gold has shed around 28 per cent in 2013, with the US Federal Reserve's plan to step away from ultra-loose monetary policy undermining the investor case for holding bullion.Years of accommodative monetary policies had propelled the price of gold to all-time highs of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011, as low interest rates encouraged investors to put money into non-interest-bearing assets.Spot gold was up 0.6 per cent to $1,202.30 an ounce at 1046 GMT, while US gold futures for February delivery fell 0.2 per cent to $1,201.90 an ounce.In wider markets, world stocks were ending 2013 close to six-year peaks and benchmark bond yields were poised for their first annual rise since 2009 as investors celebrated a pick-up in global growth with expectations of more to come.The dollar was also on track to end 2013 modestly higher against a basket of main currencies.Gold was also set to post hefty annual losses in other currencies, with prices in euros down 31 per cent on the year, the first fall since 2004. Prices fell 30 per cent in Swiss francs and 29 per cent in British pounds.
As it heralds a new year, Asia is waking up to a very different Japan. After decades of pacifism and strategic marginalisation, Japan is now shaking up the region's geopolitics by responding vigorously to China's rise. The talk of a war between Japan and China might be excessive, but the mounting tension between the two is now part of the region's political landscape.India, which hosts Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations later this month, must come to terms, like the rest of the region, with Tokyo's determination to shape the Asian security order. After he returned to power a year ago, Abe has set about transforming Japan's military strategy. He has proposed a 5 per cent increase in defence spending to $240 billion for the next five years. While approving more money for defence, Abe is aware that Tokyo can never match Beijing's rapidly growing defence budget or the size of the PLA. He, therefore, wants a military doctrine that will leverage the Japanese lead in technology, focus on Chinese vulnerabilities and let Tokyo stare Beijing in the eye.In a recently released document on national security strategy, the first ever in Japan, Abe has underlined the importance of a "dynamic deterrence" and "active defence" against the growing Chinese military challenge. Japan will now develop a marine corps of its own, integrate unmanned drones into defence plans, strengthen its capacity for real-time military intelligence, and respond effectively and immediately to Chinese intrusions into the disputed air and maritime spaces.Abe is complementing changes in the military strategy with policy change and institutional innovation. He wants to lift the ban on Japan's arms exports in order to strengthen the domestic defence industrial base. He is trying to dismantle the many self-imposed political constraints on Japan's ability to cooperate with other nations in securing the region from military threats.... contd.
AAP's water policy ignores the poor, subsidises middle class, turns its back on the need for water reform.Starting today, the new government of Delhi will deliver on one of its biggest promises. Citizens can use up to 667 litres of water a day for nothing, what Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal calls "lifeline water", a common claim to an essential resource. But despite the easy appeal of the policy, it is fiscally unwise, short-termist, and ignores the poor who lack access to piped water �  nearly half of Delhi, given that there are only 17 lakh metered connections in the city. It lavishes free water upon those who can afford to pay, and should pay �  given that there are costs involved in constructing reservoirs, maintaining pipelines, providing infrastructure and human resources. In effect, that tab will now be picked up by the state, and could involve cutting back public spending or imposing taxes on the average citizen. In the new water policy, any drop that exceeds the free amount, in the next slab of 20-30 kl, would entail a higher bill of Rs 870. Given that water meter readings are not difficult to manage, this steep tariff climb is an invitation to distortion and waste. Instead, a responsible government that knows Delhi's water problem first hand would have tried to manage demand, and to expand the water grid to those who are not served.The city is perennially parched, dependent on neighbouring Haryana, Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand. What makes it worse is systematic mismanagement of the resource � approximately 52 per cent of water is lost because of the Delhi Jal Board's (DJB's) leaky distributional pipeline. Genuine reform would involve bulk-metering systems, technology-aided monitoring at every stage, investment in treating and recycling water, improving pipelines and switching to a graded model that imposes a minimal cost on everyone, and climbs higher depending on use. It would involve bringing water to the seven lakh or so households that are now left out or dependent on an extractive tanker mafia, and making supply more reliable.... contd.
Two teenagers were Tuesday charged with brutally attacking and robbing a 20-year-old Indian student in Australia, who suffered serious head injuries in the incident.Manrajwinder Singh from Reservoir remained in an induced coma in a hospital here after being bashed up by thugs early Sunday.Singh, in Australia to study accounts, was sitting with two other friends near the footpath east of Princess Bridge when they were approached by eight men, according to a police statement.The offenders, perceived to be of African appearance, assaulted Singh by kicking him on the head and hitting him with a stick.A 17-year-old Sydenham boy has been charged with intentionally causing serious injury, robbery and theft, the Victoria police said in a statement.He faced an out of sessions court hearing Tuesday and has been remanded in custody to appear at a children's court on January 2.Earlier, a 16-year-old St Albans boy was charged with serious assault and remanded in custody.The teen was recognised by Protective Services Officers (PSO) from media coverage of the incident, the statement said, adding the PSOs arrested the boy just before midnight at Sunshine Railway Station.The third arrest in the case, a 15-year-old Ascot Vale boy has been released and is expected to be charged on summons.A search is on for five others believed to be involved in the incident. The police have appealed to the public for any information to contact them.The incident was described as a cowardly attack by Detective Senior Constable Adam Foley."It was just an opportunistic target from the offenders, they've just seen them there and approached them and done what they've done," Foley said.Singh's brother Yadwinder Singh, meanwhile, pleaded for justice. "They hit him on the head and he is in coma. I couldn't believe it. My brother should get justice; he is fighting for his life," he said.
Prabhat Kumar, joint secretary in the civil aviation ministry, has been given the additional charge of of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh is learnt to have cleared Kumar's name for the DGCA after the prime minister-headed Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) failed to announce a candidate to fill the DGCA's post after Arun Mishra left.The civil aviation ministry has sought ACC approval for Kumar's appointment as the DGCA for a period of three years. "The minister gave the additional charge to Prabhat Kumar since the ACC order did not come till the end of the day of December 31, 2013," said a senior civil aviation ministry official. He added that Kumar will take charge on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Airports Authority of India chairman VP Agarwal, whose term was ending on Tuesday, got a three-month extension. "Agarwal's extension is dependent on a clearance from the Central Vigilance Commission and he gets a three months extension until CVC clearance or denial comes in," said a ministry official.In another development, Ashok Lavasa will take charge as the new civil aviation secretary after incumbent KN Srivastava retired on December 31. Lavasa is a 1980 batch IAS officer of the Haryana cadre.
Political killings in West Bengal are part of the overall strategy of the ruling Trinamool Congress to browbeat all opposition through strong-arm methods of terror and intimidation, says the editorial in the CPM's People's Democracy. Comparing the current situation with the times of political violence in the 1970s, it says that the state is "menacingly moving towards a situation reminiscent of the semi-fascist terror unleashed... during the decade of the 1970s."Supporting its claim, the editorial also enlists "political crimes" in the state, purportedly at the TMC's behest since 2011. According to the statistics presented, there have been 142 political killings, over 200 rapes, 89 farmers' suicides, over 7,400 people evicted from their homes, over 4,200 arrests based on false charges, etc. "It is, indeed, ominous that such an attack on democracy and civil liberties in West Bengal comes at a time when there seems to be a rightward shift in Indian politics. It is well-known that the Trinamool Congress has absolutely no reservations or any compunctions in doing business with the RSS/ BJP," it says, adding, "It would, therefore, be of little surprise if the projected RSS/ BJP prime ministerial aspirant receives positive vibes from the West Bengal CM."CORPORATE STOOGELike the "fake encounter specialists", who brutally kill innocent people in manipulated encounters, UPA 2 has its own hitmen, who serve the interests of corporates and other looters of national and natural wealth, says the CPI in the editorial of New Age.

*   The bombings in Russia serve as a chilling reminder of what the Winter Olympics represent to terrorists: a high-profile target with more than 2,500 athletes waving the flags of nearly 90 nations. While many Olympic leaders called for calm the day after two bombings about 400 miles from Sochi killed at least 31 people, some of the athletes heading to Sochi spoke of a different reality -- their security is never sure thing. U.S. speedskater Jilleanne Rookard said she was concerned but believes the Russians will have things locked down. Russian Olympic leader Alexander Zhukov said the bombings didn't spark a need for additional security measures because "everything necessary already has been done".Fulhamappoint Wilkins*   English Premier League strugglers Fulham have appointed former manager Ray Wilkins as assistant to new boss Rene Meulensteen to aid their battle against relegation. Meulensteen was only appointed manager at the start of December after stepping up from the role of head coach, which he held for a matter of weeks, to succeed the sacked Martin Jol. This addition follows the appointment of ex Charlton Athletic and West Ham United boss Alan Curbishley as technical director. "I am delighted that the Chairman and the CEO have, again, backed my desire for further experience and support within the backroom staff," Meulensteen told the club's website of Wilkins, who has managed Fulham before.Sunderland swoop for Alonso*   English Premier League basement dwellers Sunderland have moved quickly to reinforce their frail defence by agreeing a loan move for Fiorentina fullback Marcos Alonso until the end of the season. The 23-year-old former Real Madrid, Bolton Wanderers and Spanish under-19 defender will officially complete his move to Wearside when the January transfer window opens on Wednesday. "Marcos is a player that I have known well for a very long time," Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet told the club's website on Monday. "He was desperate to come and play for Sunderland and he is a player I am excited to work with." Poyet has made new signings a priority.... contd.
Every year, kids with big forehands and bigger ambitions, are subjected to a plethora of voices. Some voices are from within, others they can do without. The players who find success at an early age, few in number, are usually the ones that managed to weed out the wrong from the right.Yuki Bhambri was one of those few.In 2009, at just 17, he was the Australian Open boys' singles champion � a junior Grand Slam champion, just like Bernard Tomic had been in the previous year in Melbourne and Grigor Dimitrov had been in the previous year in New York.But while Tomic and Dimitrov soon found their calling as professionals with career high rankings in the low 20s, the voices had caught up with Bhambri.When Dimitrov and Tomic boasted of reaching the third round and quarterfinals of the French and Wimbledon respectively, Bhambri � who is yet to make the main draw of a Slam � played hard to make the second round of the Chennai Open. Before this week began, he had gotten there once in six attempts.The critics sharpened their vocal cords. Some blamed his game. Few wagged fingers at his fitness. Others faulted the facilities around him. By August this year, his ranking fell to a low of 593. All this, while his first round opponent at the 2014 Chennai Open, 22-year old Pablo Carreno Busta, moved astonishingly from a ranking of 700 something to 64th in the last 12 months.On Tuesday, Bhambri and Busta, boys who had crossed each other in opposite directions on the ladder, met. Dealing with those sniggering voices must not have been easy, but the Indian stepped it up on Chennai's show court to bridge the gap.A straight sets win (6-4, 6-3) in the first round of an ATP 250 event may not be much, but for Bhambri it was one step taken on a long and arduous journey ahead. At Nungambakkam on New Year's eve, Bhambri showed that he had the game and the tenacity to walk the remainder of that journey, with a strong and clinical performance.... contd.
Pakistan took an early advantage after fast bowlers Junaid Khan and debutant Bilawal Bhatti bowled out Sri Lanka for 204 on Tuesday on the opening day of the first Test. Captain Angelo Mathews launched a counterattack by hitting 91 off 147 balls with 15 fours to give the total some respectability before he was the last man to be dismissed.Pakistan was 46-1 at stumps with debutant Ahmed Shehzad unbeaten on 25 as Khurram Manzoor was run out in the last over. Khan (5-58) had his fourth five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka while Bhatti (3-65) made an impressive debut by claiming three wickets in eight balls after lunch, which started a dramatic collapse as Sri Lanka lost seven wickets for just 57 runs.Bhatti had Mahela Jaywardene (5) caught behind and Khan got the vital wicket of prolific run-scorer Kumar Sangakkara (16) and Sri Lanka's experienced batsmen surely looked rusty from their nine-month break of test matches since last competing against Bangladesh in March.It was Pakistan, who looked to have lost the plot after captain Misbah-ul-Haq won the toss on a greenish wicket of Sheikh Zayed Stadium when Dimuth Karunaratne (38) and Kaushal Perera (20) provided a solid start of 57 runs.Karunaratne was quick to punish any overpitched delivery and Sri Lanka scored a brisk 50 runs in the first hour off fast bowlers Khan, Bhatti and Rahat Ali.Karunaratne hit five fours before Asad Shafiq took a brilliant catch off Khan to remove him but Sri Lanka still managed to have a decent start of 66-1 by lunch. Pakistan also lost one of its two television referrals when they thought Khan had found the outside edge of Perera's bat on 18, but TV umpire Sundaram Ravi upheld the not out decision.In a stunning turnaround after lunch, Bhatti ignited the collapse when he had Perera (20), Mahela Jayawardene (5) and Dinesh Chandimal (0) dismissed in eight balls and Khan wrecked the lower middle order.... contd.
Arsenal can complete a quick double over managerless Cardiff City and consolidate their position at the top of the table when the relentless Premier League holiday schedule continues on New Year's Day. While players and fans in other countries have a rest from soccer over the holidays, Wednesday's matches will be the fourth in little over 10 days in England.With the campaign at the halfway mark after 19 matches, Arsenal, with 42 points, lead the table at the start of the new year for the first time since the 2007-08 season. They are followed by Manchester City (41), Chelsea (40) and Everton (37). The race is so close that Liverpool, who were top at Christmas, are now fifth on 36 points after two defeats in four days at Manchester City and Chelsea.Brendan Rodgers's side, who are at home to Hull City, are only two points clear of both champions Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, who meet at Old Trafford on Wednesday.The situation is even tighter at the other end with only seven points separating 11th-placed Swansea City (21) and table-propping Sunderland, who gained a point at Cardiff on Saturday in a 2-2 draw.Serena sweats it out, wins season-openerbrisbane: World number one Serena Williams looked rusty in her first competitive match of the season ahead of the Australian Open but battled through to beat Andrea Petkovic 6-4 6-4 at the Brisbane International on Tuesday. The number one seed won in 98 minutes to reach the quarter-finals but her 36 unforced errors and 55 percent serving accuracy showed how much Williams has to work on with the first grand slam of 2014 less than a fortnight away.German Petkovic was exactly what the defending champion needed at this point in the season. She ensured the five-times Australian Open winner had to fight for every point across both sets.... contd.
Skipper Sami Aslam (108) made a century as Pakistan colts held on to their nerves to pull off a narrow two-wicket win over India in the Under-19 Asia Cup here on Tuesday. Pakistan chased down a challenging 251 with just three balls to spare and registered their third straight win of the tournament.Riding on Ricky Bhui's quick-fire half-century, India scored 250 for seven off their quota of 50 overs after electing to bat at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. India got off to a solid start with openers Ankush Bains (41) and Akhil Herwadkar (31) putting on 74 runs in 13.3 overs.  However, Pakistan leg-spinner Karamat Ali brought his side back into the match as he removed the top-three batsmen, including skipper Vijay Zol (20) to reduce India to 116 for three.Ali kept a tight leash on the Indian batters as he finished with figures of four for 28 in his 10 overs. Bhui put on small but significant partnerships of 36, 42 and 45 with Sanju Samson (38), Sarfaraz Khan (20) and Deepak Hooda (24) to take side to a testing total. Ricky's 66-ball-64 included three fours and two sixes. In reply, left-handed Aslam led from the front as he smacked Indian bowlers to all parts of the ground. He laid the foundation for his side and put on 72 runs with Hasan Raza (30) for the third wicket. Aslam 119-ball knock included 11 fours and a six. Kamaran Ghulam (55) then took on the mantle to take his side to the finishing line.But two consecutive wickets - Ghulam off the final ball of the penultimate over and followed by another on the next delivery - made the contest intriguing.Pakistan required five off five balls to seal the match, which Zafar Gohar (8 not out) achieved by hitting consecutive boundaries of Chama Milind. Both teams have already qualified for the semi-finals in which India will meet Sri Lanka on January 2 while Pakistan will clash against Afghanistan on the same day.... contd.
The national selectors, on Tuesday, sprang a surprise by naming uncapped all-rounder Stuart Binny in the 16-member squad for the five-match ODI series in New Zealand that starts at Napier on January 19. Binny replaces Yuvraj Singh, the out-of-form all-rounder who was instrumental in India winning the 2011 World Cup. Yuvraj in his last 8 outings had scored 118 runs.Binny, whose father Roger was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team and is presently one of the selectors, had been a stand-out performer for Rajasthan Royals in last season's Indian Premier League. The medium pacer cum lower order batsman scored 293 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 147.23 and took six wickets with an economy rate of 6.75. Turning up for Karnataka, he has cored 281 runs from six Ranji Trophy games and took 11 wickets. This comes after a dream 2012-13 season when the 29-year-old finished with 612 runs at 47.07 and took 19 wickets at 41.89.With New Zealand expected to welcome India with green-tops, there was a school of thought that the selections should pick a technically proficient specialist who had the skills to negotiate the moving ball. After scoring 280 runs in two Tests in South Africa, Cheteshwar Pujara was the man. But by going for a a bits and pieces players, it is clear the Pujara doesn't seem to be figure in the scheme of things as the selectors look test players for the next year's World Cup that will be jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia.Pujara's List A average is 54.57 in 68 matches. He scored 199 runs in five List A games when he led India A to a tri-series in South Africa in August. Binny, on the other hand, has a List A average of 22.30 in 48 matches, though it has to be said he bats down the order. He also has 37 wickets at 36.64. In the three matches he played for India A in South Africa he scored six runs.... contd.
It is inevitable that the latest call-up to the Indian ODI squad, Stuart Binny would face additional scrutiny for being the son of selector Roger Binny. However, at least on the day he made the cut for the New Zealand tour, Binny Junior, gave enough and more testament to his ability with a game-changing knock albeit in a different format. Coming into bat with his side both stuck in first gear on a tricky Feroze Shah Kotla pitch and precariously placed at 73/4 after 35 overs, Binny resurrected the innings, hitting six sixes and seven boundaries in a 94-ball 88. Binny would be dismissed with Karnataka two runs short of Delhi's first innings total 202, but his side eventually took the first innings lead and at stumps were comfortably placed at  226/5.While Binny's knock essentially pulled the rug from under Delhi's feet. The hosts needed to win the game to have any chance of progressing to the knock outs, were hamstrung from the start of the day.  Poor visibility delayed the start for close to two hours and it stayed bad enough for umpires to force spinner Varun Sood and military medium Rajat Bhatia to bowl first, instead of Ashish Nehra and Sumit Narwal, who would have been best-placed to take advantage of overcast conditions. Bhatia though delivered for Delhi by bowling opener Mayank Agarwal in his first over. Eventually the light improved enough for Nehra to be introduced, and the pacer got R Samarth pulling to Sood at square leg. The pitch wasn't giving much turn but had no pace on it either, forcing batsmen to generate all the power. In addition the ball was keeping low and through two such deliveries, Varun Sood got last match's centurion Manish Pandey and Abrar Kazi out LBW. ... contd.
UP IN DIDI'S SIGHTsEven before it sits down to draw up its list of candidates from Bengal in the Lok Sabha polls, Mamata Banerjee has decided her candidate on at least one Lok Sabha seat in faraway UP. Her party's only MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Manth constituency Shyam Sunder Sharma will be the TMC candidate from Mathura. Sharma is learnt to have assured the party of victory and the party has no reason to not believe him. In fact, encouraged by the TMC's good fortunes in recent panchayat polls in Bengal, Mamata has decided to field candidates in Kerala as well. TMC second in command, Mukul Roy, inaugurated the party's state headquarters in Kochi last week.VACANCIES AT MHATop slots in the MHA are falling vacant with the ministry set to lose two more top bureaucrats who are returning to their cadre ahead of the general election. Additional secretary from Tamil Nadu K Skandan has gone back to his cadre while K A Ganai, additional secretary, is also moving back to J&K cadre. Skandan, who was handling charges of Centre-states relations and J&K was instrumental during the creation of Telangana while Ganai was handling foreigners, police modernisation, UT division in the ministry. The MHA, however, appears to be in no hurry to fill the slots. It is still to pick candidates for these two posts even as another post of special secretary (internal secretary) is lying vacant for the past three months.MISSING THE ACTIONBureaucrats it seems are loathe to miss their vacations no matter what else they might miss. Principal DG PIB Neelam Kapoor missed the launch of the DAVP calendar which the who's who of the I&B Ministry attended  Tuesday. Sources say she will just make it for the Prime Minister's press conference, joining office a day before. While the 2014 DAVP calendar itself celebrates the successes of the UPA government, it skips all mention of major missions like NRHM, the newly launched urban health mission and even the monumental achievement of eradicating polio. I&B Minister Manish Tewari said health achievements could not be accommodated as "there are only 12 months in a year".... contd.
French doctors treating Michael Schumacher for brain injuries sustained in a ski fall said the seven-times Formula One world champion was in slightly better condition on Tuesday after an overnight operation, but he remained fragile.The 44-year-old German is battling for his life after slamming his head against a rock while skiing off-piste in the French resort of Meribel on Sunday, an accident which triggered an outpouring of concern among fans around the world.Doctors treating him at a hospital in the eastern city of Grenoble said his condition had stabilised enough by late Monday to carry out a new operation to treat the effects of internal bleeding within Schumacher's skull."The situation is more under control than yesterday but we cannot say he is out of danger," Jean-Francois Payen, head anaesthetician, told a news conference at the CHU hospital in the eastern French city of Grenoble."We have won some time but we must continue an hour-by-hour surveillance... It is premature to speculate on his condition," he said, adding that Schumacher was still in a critical state and suffering from severe lesions and contusions.Emmanuel Gay, head of the hospital's neurosurgery service, said the operation carried out around 10.00 pm (2100 GMT) on Monday had successfully removed a large hematoma - the medical term for a build-up of blood - from his brain."It was larger and more accessible (than others) ... We judged we could remove it without taking any risks," Gay said.He said the operation was designed to reduce the pressure on the brain.Helmet crucialDoctors said the fact that the retired motor racing champion was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident had at least enabled him to make it to the hospital alive.Payen said the medical team in Grenoble had discussed the operation with Schumacher's family. He added that the condition of the motor racing great was still too fragile to consider transferring him to another hospital for the time being.... contd.
These have been a frustrating few weeks for Iqbal Abdulla. Despite some decent performances under his belt, like his four-wicket haul against Punjab, the selectors continued to give the left-arm spinner a cold shoulder repeatedly pointing out he wasn't up to the mark. However, with Mumbai playing at Gujarat and under pressure to win and qualify for the knockout stages, the selectors persisted with the tried-and-tested spinner. Perhaps, his past performance at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium here worked for him. His last five-wicket haul had come at this venue against the same opposition back in 2008.On Tuesday, Abdulla repaid the selectors' faith and justified his selection by picking up six wickets in the do-or-die game, keeping Mumbai's hopes of making the quarter-finals alive. Defending a meagre total of 154, Abdulla's fine spell marginally helped apply the skid-breaks on Gujarat and stop them from running away with the game as they notched up 253, a lead of 99. At stumps on Day Two, the visitors were 76 for four, still trailing by 23 runs, and staring at the steepest challenge of the season.But earlier on Tuesday, realising they needed quick wickets to stand any chance of making a comeback, Mumbai began on a bright note with medium-pacer Shardul Thakur removing Parthiv Patel soon after play began. Then, it was the time for Abdulla show.Ever since Mumbai found another left-arm spinner in Vishal Dabholkar last season, Abdulla's spot in the starting XI has been uncertain. Experts suggested he was more suited to the T20 format as he lacked variations and did not have a traditional spin bowlers' approach.However, he proved them wrong on Tuesday. He kept up the pressure from one end and looked the only bowler who could run through Gujarat's line-up. Abdulla added to his overnight tally by trapping opener Samit Gohel in front of stumps. Manprit Juneja, who himself is going through a rough patch, started well but was caught at slips by Wasim Jaffer off Abdulla. The left-armer didn't have much trouble finishing off Gujarat's tail-enders Chirag Gandhi, Rakesh Dhruv and Ishwar Choudhary.... contd.
At the end of the first day's play in Johannesburg, India had batted themselves into a decent position. The score read 255/5, their position looking even more robust because their captain was still at the crease. The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to not just set his record right in conditions outside the subcontinent. This was his chance to ride home the advantage for his team. It wasn't to be though as Dhoni perished, poking at a Vernon Philander delivery leaving him. One that could have been left alone. His dismissal for 19 also set in the rot as India lost their four wickets for not much.It wasn't the only time Dhoni set off a collapse or got out just when the situation called out for him to play a knock of significance. At Durban in the first innings, he and Ajinkya Rahane had helped India regain control with a 50-run stand for the fifth wicket. They had also taken India past the 300-run mark. Then Dhoni, batting on 24, went chasing after another length delivery outside his off-stump with his unique 'walking shot'. This time from a charged-up Steyn. Yet again the Indian skipper had fallen in the same fashion as has become customary of him in conditions where the ball moves around. The most disappointing of the lot was reserved for when India needed Dhoni the most. On the last day of the tour with the visitors hanging by the skin of their teeth to save the second Test and ensure that they walk away with a 0-0 verdict �which would have been akin to a win for India.The South African pacers had just finished their umpteenth spell on the day. Manning the attack now was Robin Peterson bowling from over the wicket into the rough, and hardly turning a ball. Just then Dhoni decided to use his forearms and muscle a length delivery outside his leg-stump over the mid-wicket fielder. Not only was the shot not on, it was also uncalled for considering the situation, especially with Rahane fighting tooth and nail at the other end to keep India's hopes alive. The ball only went as far as Alviro Petersen at mid-wicket. Dhoni could only throw his head sideways in despair. Soon after, the Indian tail lived up to their reputation and was blown away.... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.

Gold fell to a six-month low in thin year-end trade on Tuesday, notching up its biggest annual decline in 32 years as prospects for global economic recovery prompted investors to switch to riskier assets.After a 12-year bull run, gold has shed 28 percent in 2013, with the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to step away from ultra-loose monetary policy undermining the investor rationale for holding bullion.Years of accommodative monetary policies had propelled the price of gold to all-time highs of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011, as low interest rates encouraged investors to put money into non-interest-bearing assets.In choppy trade on Tuesday, spot gold fell 1 percent to its lowest since June 28 at $1,184.50 an ounce, before recovering its lost ground. Prices were up 0.38 percent at $1,201.13 per ounce at 2:29 p.m. EDT (1929 GMT).U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled at $1,202.3, down $1.5 an ounce, having earlier fallen to a low of $1,181.40. That was down 28 percent from the end of last year.Bullion was the third-largest loser for the year on the 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB index, after corn and silver."For the first three months of the year at least we are quite pessimistic on gold and a break below $1,180 could trigger further declines to the $1,000 mark," T-Commodity partner Ganclaudio Torlizzi said."Moreover, the dollar should strengthen towards the euro in January, as the economy improves, and that's another bearish element for gold," he added. "For the time being, investors will continue to put their money into equities."World stocks were ending 2013 close to six-year peaks and benchmark bond yields were poised for their first annual rise since 2009 as investors celebrated a pick-up in global growth with expectations of more to come.The dollar was on track to end 2013 modestly higher against a basket of main currencies.... contd.

It may rain jobs in the new year as companies are gearing up to add over 8 lakh new employees to their payrolls and dole out salary hikes of up to 20 per cent to best performers in 2014, say experts.As per estimates of various human resource consultants, the year 2014 seems very promising for job market unlike 2013, when hiring went slow across mid and senior levels and recruitments were done only to replace 'key' gaps.In the new year, the country is likely to witness a huge surge of opportunities for job seekers with more and more corporates investing in their businesses."Yes, 2014 looks bullish on hiring. 2014 will be seen as a good happening year from the jobs perspective as the global economy is improving and India being one of the largest service provider for the global market," leading executive search firm GlobalHunt MD Sunil Goel said. According to industry estimates, over 8.5 lakh new jobs may be created in the calender year 2014. The issuance of new banking licences will be a major contributor, while IT, healthcare, agri-business, infrastructure and education sectors are also likely to witness robust hiring trends."Last calendar year was not good either for job seekers or for employers due to uncertain and fluctuated economical and political conditions. 2014 is coming with positive vibes for jobseekers and expecting to create 8.5 lacs new jobs in different sectors," Rajesh Kumar, CEO, MyHiringClub.com & FlikJobs.com said.With regards to salary, the average hike for most sectors is expected in single digits, while top performers can expect pay rise of around 15-20 per cent in 2014, experts say."This New Year is going to bring cheer for employees with a salary hike of double-digit of at least 10-12 per cent. In 2014, companies are expected to revise the compensation package and explore a more motivational approach," Indian Staffing Federation Vice President Rituparna Chakraborty said.... contd.

Tata Power Ltd today welcomed Arvind Kejriwal's Delhi Government announcement of providing 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units, saying it was a "good move" which will provide relief to majority of the consumers in the city."It is a good move from the point of view of consumers. It will provide them relief. I welcome the decision by the government," Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (TPDDL) CEO Pravir Sinha said.Delivering on yet another poll promise, the Aam Aadmi government yesterday announced a 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units in Delhi, which will benefit around 28 lakh of the total 35 lakh consumers in the city.When asked about Government's move to order CAG scrutiny of the finances of the three private power distribution companies, Sinha chose not to comment but said TPDDL will comply with the law.He, however, said TPDDL was responding to government's directive of making their stand clear on the CAG scrutiny of the companies."If the law of the land demands that (the CAG audit), we will definitely comply with the directive.

Apple Inc said it had no "backdoor" in its products after a security researcher and a leaked document suggested the US National Security Agency had unfettered access to the iPhone.Apple said that it "has never worked with the NSA to create a backdoor in any of our products, including iPhone."The statement added that " we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products."Security researcher Jacob Applebaum described the NSA program based on a purportedly leaked document about NSA access to the iPhone, in comments made in Germany. Apple said it "is continuously working to make our products even more secure, and we make it easy for customers to keep their software up to date with the latest advancements... and will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers and defend our customers from security attacks, regardless of who's behind them."Applebaum told a security conference in Germany that the program called DROPOUTJEEP allowed the NSA to intercept SMS messages, access contact lists, locate a phone using cell tower data, access voice mail or activate an iPhone's microphone and camera.He described it as "an iPhone backdoor" that allowed the NSA to access any iPhone.The documents were also described in the German newspaper Der Spiegel.Security researcher Graham Cluley said in a blog post that Applebaum's presentation and the documents show a "broader range of tools that the NSA apparently deploys against other technology companies and products, including HP (Hewlett-Packard) servers, Cisco firewalls, Huawei routers, and so on."But Cluley said the document "does not mean that the NSA has complete control of your iPhone" because physical access to the device would be needed."It may be that they have since found unpatched vulnerabilities in iOS to install the spyware onto targeted devices remotely... but that's not what the leaked documents say," Cluley said.... contd.

Camera manufacturers are a worried lot. The improvement in phone cameras have over the past few years eroded almost all of their business in the point and shoot range. Almost everyone clicks pictures these days, but not all are using something that has been built exclusively for the purpose. This is why innovation has become the key to survival in the camera business. Nikon pushed the envelope a bit too far when it launched the D800 with a 36MP sensor, Canon was silent for a while before it thought of the ultra compact 100D. But since then, most of the innovation has happened from Sony, not exactly the first name that comes to your mind when you think of cameras. They launched the stunning RX1, a compact camera with a full-frame sensor, the RX100s that took compact cameras to a whole new level and now the new Sony Alpha a7 and a7R DSLRs, both full-frame mirror-less cameras in very manageable sizes. I put the Sony a7 to the test. Design  The design reminded me a lot of the RX1. In fact, the body is not much larger even though this is a full-frame DSLR. But the RX1, the great camera that it is, would develop a serious complex in front of this one. That is because this has a tiltable LCD panel, a proper eye piece though looking into an electronic OLED viewfinder and whole range of lenses to play with. It is compact, but build like a Colt with a body that will weather most storms, and dust storms, that come its way. All the ports are tucked away behind sturdy flaps. Despite the small built, the camera offers a very steady, DSLR-like, grip. There is a thumb rest near where all the controls are settles. There is a ring here to adjust the settings and another on up front accessible with your fingers. While framing a shot, both these will come in more than handy. There are two customisable buttons that maker life much easier. Plus, you can switch between auto focus and auto exposure lock on the body itself. I would have preferred this to have been a switch for manual focus. ... contd.
Gold fell to a six-month low in thin year-end trade on Tuesday, notching up its biggest annual decline in 32 years as prospects for global economic recovery prompted investors to switch to riskier assets.After a 12-year bull run, gold has shed 28 percent in 2013, with the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to step away from ultra-loose monetary policy undermining the investor rationale for holding bullion.Years of accommodative monetary policies had propelled the price of gold to all-time highs of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011, as low interest rates encouraged investors to put money into non-interest-bearing assets.In choppy trade on Tuesday, spot gold fell 1 percent to its lowest since June 28 at $1,184.50 an ounce, before recovering its lost ground. Prices were up 0.38 percent at $1,201.13 per ounce at 2:29 p.m. EDT (1929 GMT).U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled at $1,202.3, down $1.5 an ounce, having earlier fallen to a low of $1,181.40. That was down 28 percent from the end of last year.Bullion was the third-largest loser for the year on the 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB index, after corn and silver."For the first three months of the year at least we are quite pessimistic on gold and a break below $1,180 could trigger further declines to the $1,000 mark," T-Commodity partner Ganclaudio Torlizzi said."Moreover, the dollar should strengthen towards the euro in January, as the economy improves, and that's another bearish element for gold," he added. "For the time being, investors will continue to put their money into equities."World stocks were ending 2013 close to six-year peaks and benchmark bond yields were poised for their first annual rise since 2009 as investors celebrated a pick-up in global growth with expectations of more to come.The dollar was on track to end 2013 modestly higher against a basket of main currencies.... contd.

Yet another LPG price hike (non-subsidised cooking gas, which customers buy after consuming their quota of subsidised cylinders) has been effected today, with the govt announcing a steep rise of Rs 220 per cylinder on firming international rates.The 14.2-kg LPG gas cylinder that consumers buy beyond their entitled nine bottles at subsidised rates, will now cost Rs 1,241, up from Rs 1,021 in Delhi, state-owned fuel retailers said.This is the third increase in non-subsidised LPG rates in the past month. The price was hiked by Rs 63 a cylinder to Rs 1,017.50 on December 1. It was increased by a further Rs 3.50 to Rs 1,021 on December 11, when the government raised the commission for LPG dealers and distributors.The government had in September 2012 capped the supply of subsidised domestic LPG cylinders to six per household in a year. The quota was raised to nine bottles per household in a year in January 2013.Any requirement above this limit has to be purchased at market rates. There is no restriction on the number of non-subsidised cylinders that a consumer can buy.State-owned oil companies revise rates of non-subsidised LPG on the 1st of every month, based on the average imported cost and rupee-US dollar rate during the previous month.A subsidised, 14.2-kg cylinder of LPG costs Rs 414 in Delhi. Officials said state-owned oil firms currently lose Rs 762.70 per cylinder on the sale of subsidised LPG.Non-subsidised LPG price in Mumbai has been increased to Rs 1,264.50 per cylinder from Rs 1,038.International LPG rates have firmed up due to increased winter heating demand.
Looking to safeguard the interest of small investors and overall market place, Sebi has identified a greater oversight mechanism on insider trading and a stronger risk management framework as among key focus areas for 2014."In the new year, our focus areas will be strengthening the insider trading mechanism and further strengthening the risk management system on the exchanges," Sebi Chairman U K Sinha said while listing out key priorities before the capital markets regulator in 2014."These are the two major focus areas.

It may rain jobs in the new year as companies are gearing up to add over 8 lakh new employees to their payrolls and dole out salary hikes of up to 20 per cent to best performers in 2014, say experts.As per estimates of various human resource consultants, the year 2014 seems very promising for job market unlike 2013, when hiring went slow across mid and senior levels and recruitments were done only to replace 'key' gaps.In the new year, the country is likely to witness a huge surge of opportunities for job seekers with more and more corporates investing in their businesses."Yes, 2014 looks bullish on hiring. 2014 will be seen as a good happening year from the jobs perspective as the global economy is improving and India being one of the largest service provider for the global market," leading executive search firm GlobalHunt MD Sunil Goel said. According to industry estimates, over 8.5 lakh new jobs may be created in the calender year 2014. The issuance of new banking licences will be a major contributor, while IT, healthcare, agri-business, infrastructure and education sectors are also likely to witness robust hiring trends."Last calendar year was not good either for job seekers or for employers due to uncertain and fluctuated economical and political conditions. 2014 is coming with positive vibes for jobseekers and expecting to create 8.5 lacs new jobs in different sectors," Rajesh Kumar, CEO, MyHiringClub.com & FlikJobs.com said.With regards to salary, the average hike for most sectors is expected in single digits, while top performers can expect pay rise of around 15-20 per cent in 2014, experts say."This New Year is going to bring cheer for employees with a salary hike of double-digit of at least 10-12 per cent. In 2014, companies are expected to revise the compensation package and explore a more motivational approach," Indian Staffing Federation Vice President Rituparna Chakraborty said.... contd.

Likely to open by end of March, the new aquarium will have a touch pool, where curious visitors can touch star fish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and turtles. This year, exotic fish from overseas will be introduced at the new aquarium with fisheries officials pegging the number of new varieties of marine fish at 70. You can try and find Nemo in the Maroon Clownfish tank, besides getting to see Azure Damsel, Blueline Demoiselle, Purple Firefish, Cloudy Damsel, Copperband Butterflyfish, Schooling Bannerfish, Raccoon Butterflyfish, White Tail Trigger, Clown Triggerfish and Blue Ribbon Eel.

A special semi-circular tank has been designed to house the jelly fish.For those more inclined towards learning about fishes and the marine ecosystem, the new aquarium will have a 50-seater theatre screening documentaries on fish, marine ecosystems and environment conservation. ... contd.
The big screen once used for showing films now stands lifeless. The expanse of the wooden stage lies before it, with workers occasionally walking around to clean the place. Very few, however, are aware that underneath this platform stands a big room with a narrow well at its centre. Before it was converted into a talkie in 1926, Dhobitalao's Edward Theatre used to be a space for staging plays. Although Fred Poonawala, the managing partner of the theatre, says the place dates back to mid-1800s. The exact date of its construction is not known, he adds. It has since retained its original plan and structure, including the orchestra pit, balconies, the two green rooms at the back as well as the room below the stage. Edward Theatre's legacy is well known but few are aware of the room atop which the film screen now sits. "My guess is the room was used as a place where the performers gathered before and after the performance or during the break time," he says, adding that it served the purpose of performers to enter and exit the stage. There is also a contraption, although not currently in operation, which perhaps allowed a performer to rise up to the stage from below. Currently, the room is used by the theatre's staff as a space where they can take a breather. The well, Poonawala adds, must have been used by performers for freshening up. The need for it perhaps arose from the fact that the entertainment space needs to be self-sufficient. "But it was also used as a water catchment by residents of the Dhobitalao area," adds Poonawala who is attempting to revive Edward Theatre's legacy as a space for performing arts. dipti.nagpaul@expressindia.com
Four former Congress chief ministers, two serving NCP ministers, a BJP MP's kin and top bureaucrats are under scanner in the Adarsh housing scam. Senior NCP ministers faced the heat over allegations of rampant corruption in irrigation projects. In 2013, Maharashtra struggled to come to grips with cases of corruption and crony capitalism just like several other states.Would 2014 usher in a welcome change? Though cynicism on overcoming the malaise continues to be high, the new year brings some hope in the form of a stronger Lokayukta (LA).The Congress, rattled by the rout in recent Assembly polls in four states, has decided to push the anti-corruption agenda to regain lost ground. After enacting the Lokpal Bill, it has now directed all Congress-ruled states to empower LA institutions. On December 28, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said the Maharashtra LA and the Upa-Lokayukta (ULA) will be strengthened within two months.Sources said the plan was to provide the LA and the ULA with their own prosecution wings. While the final modalities are being worked out, the plan is also to bring senior government functionaries, including ministers, in the LA ambit. It is also proposed to grant powers to attach and seize properties acquired by public servants through illegal means; powers to recommend the transfer and suspension of erring officials, besides power to secure services of state and Central government officials.Former Karnataka Lokayukta Justice (retd) Santosh Hegde said, "While strong LAs in states and Lokpal at the Centre cannot wipe off corruption completely, they can reduce it to a great extent."Though the state was the first to have a LA and a ULA � the legislation in this regard was enacted in 1971 �government functionaries conceded that they have remained mere 'paper tigers' owing to lack of autonomy. "To the best of my knowledge, the Maharashtra LA enjoys no powers at all. It has also not been provided the infrastructure required to be effective," said Hegde.... contd.
Tucked away in Kemps Corner at the Khareghat Colony lies Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum, the city's only community museum dedicated to Parsi artefacts. But over the years, as with most heritage structures in the city, the building has come under disrepair. But 2014 brings great news with it. In a three-phase plan, over five years, the museum will be restored to more than its former glory."The organisers of the 10th World Zoroastrian Congress wanted to leave a lasting legacy on the city, so I asked them to take up the issue of restoring the Alpaiwalla Museum. The structure is fabulous and didn't need much work, but the roof was leaking and the toilets were not usable. That has been changed. Also the museum was last restored 30 years ago, so the display techniques are all old. We want to change it according to current world standards," says Pheroza Godrej, an art conservationist and honorary consultant to the museum. The restoration project is being financed by the Mumbai Parsi Punchayet. The Parsi diaspora has also come forward to donate for its renovation.The museum will be inaugurated today with a small ceremony, although no artefacts will be displayed. Godrej says they'd like to change shows every three to four months. One of the first shows will have a reproduction of the western staircase from the Apadana in Persepolis in a 12-foot-long glass fabrication. The second is a replica of the sanctum sanctorum of an agiary. Both the pieces were made, thanks to the sponsorship of philanthropist Dr Cyrus Poonawala and was shown at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in the UK last year. The first phase is to make sure the structure of the building is fine and to recruit a team to manage the museum's daily functioning. The second phase has two parts � one where the showcases and lighting will be changed and the second where the artefacts will be restored. ... contd.
U.S. stocks closed 2013 by setting record highs and world equity markets ended at six-year peaks on Tuesday, while benchmark bond yields posted their first annual rise since 2009.Ultra-easy monetary policies and an improving economic outlook worldwide led to a stellar year for stocks. Equity strategists see the gains continuing into 2014 as economic growth improves even as the Federal Reserve steadily trims its bond-buying stimulus."This has been a terrific year, with all the concerns we had in January proving unfounded, and with current economic growth giving us a strong outlook for 2013," said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston.The S&P 500 benchmark ended its best year since 1997 with a 29 percent gain. More than 450 of the stocks in the index ended the year higher, the most since S&P started collecting that data in 1980. Japan's Nikkei ended the year up 56.7 percent and European shares gained 16 percent.MSCI's all-country world equity index was up 0.22 percent at 408.33, its highest level since late 2007. It has gained 20 percent this year.The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index of investment-grade bonds ended with its worst year since 1994, as interest rates rose in anticipation of reduced Fed stimulus and higher-yielding stocks attracted more investment flows.Assets favored by investors in economic downturns took a beating in 2013, with falling prices driving top-rated U.S. and German bond yields to near their highest levels in around two years and gold limping toward its worst annual performance in three decades, losing more than 27 percent.The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which sets the standard for global borrowing costs, has risen to 3 percent from 1.75 percent at the start of the year, but is seen rising to only 3.35 percent in 2014. The 10-year note was yielding 3.02 percent on Tuesday.... contd.
For the last century-and-a-half, Mumbaikars have relied on the suburban railway system to efficiently ferry them around the city. Nearly 160 years after the first engine chugged out on a trial run from Bombay to Thane, the efficient but aging and grubby mass transit system will face competition from two sleek new transportation systems that will make their debut in Mumbai in 2014.Driving this change will be 100-plus men and women with an average age of 25 who will be at the helm of these new systems.For those used to seeing bored-looking middle-aged men driving the suburban rail system, the young, smartly dressed drivers of these transportation systems of the Metro and monorail will come as a refreshing surprise.Termed as "Train Captains" and "Metro pilots," men such as 23-year-old Setal Patel and his contemporary Priyanka Balit (23) will be in charge of driving the swanky monorail and the Metro and phenomenally change the way Mumbai looks at travel in 2014."It is an exhilarating feeling that we will be in charge of driving a system that will be used for the first time in Mumbai and completely change the way the city travels," says an excited Balit, who will be one of the first few women drivers running the Metro on its 11.07-km route from Versova to Ghatkopar.Close to 16 trains will be run on the Versova-Andheri stretch for which 63 "Metro Captains" are being trained at various locations, including Versova.Interestingly, the Metro has also opened up new job avenues for hundreds of people from all sections of the society.Balit's father is a driver in the Gulf and the Vikhroli resident says that being a first generation engineer, the new job which places safety of almost 1,500 commuters in her hands, has done a lot to boost her self-confidence.... contd.
It takes some time to adjust to the fact that 'he' is an 'it'. Standing on the second floor balcony of Mohammedbhoy Mansion at Kemps Corner, a lone figure, a bare male trunk, a mannequin, has over the years moonlighted as a landmark. That he has now achieved quirk status only makes 'it' special.The occupant in the second floor apartment, French entrepreneur Siddharth G, 34, and his girlfriend spotted it during their walks around Colaba lanes. "There were body parts in half. A store was throwing them away, just like that. So we picked the best parts and assembled it here, on the balcony. It was 2006, it has been here since," he explains.Over the years, Siddharth has developed a way to introduce himself. "In gatherings and parties, when I meet people, I ask them if they know this house by the corner which has a mannequin on its balcony," he says. "So many people have their own stories, they have met beneath my house using the mannequin as a landmark," he laughs.Siddharth, who lives with two cats Mowgli "like in Jungle book" and Nokia "as in the phone", the mannequin is as much a housemate. While one neighbour gushes that "he might have Parsi blood in him", another suspects "the mannequin is mostly to scare the pigeons". Siddharth says it's neither."In France, when we place the national flag outside the window, nobody troubles you. When I came here, I placed a huge Indian flag across the balcony. It was full of Indian colours, bright. The police pulled it down the next morning. Now I have the mannequin," he says.Initially, the expat took him along to all parties. "Being French, I used to arrange parties themed 'An Evening in Paris'. I used to place the mannequin wherever � in the middle or someplace at the party � as my mascot, my identity," he adds. ... contd.
Built in 1878, Mumbai's iconic Rajabai Clock Tower is undergoing restoration for the first time in 135 years. Come monsoon this year, the renovated clock tower and the restored Mumbai University (MU) library building it stands on, will be unveiled. Like it did in days gone by, the restored tower will chime a different tune every 15 minutes.The clock tower has an interesting history. It was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott on the lines of the famous Big Ben in London and its cost of Rs 2 lakh was funded by Premchand Roychand, the founding member of the Bombay Stock Exchange. He named it after his mother Rajabai. With failing eyesight, Rajabai could not tell the time, and wished to eat her dinner before the sun set. Roychand, therefore, built her a clock tower that would chime every 15 minutes. For the restoration of the iconic tower, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has donated Rs 4.2 crore to MU, says Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the university, Dr Naresh Chandra. Head of the architectural firm Somaya and Kalappa that has been hired for the job, Brinda Somaya says that working on the restoration of such a beautiful structure is every architect's dream. "The work began post-monsoon last year. We opened up the roof of the tower and began the restoration work. The initial cleaning of the stones and removing the vegetative growth is done. We're reinstalling the fire systems and electrical conduits," she says.Somaya explains that there is an attempt to make the heritage building more disabled-friendly. "We are constantly brainstorming about what we can do to make the building more accessible to everyone. Renovation is not just about cosmetic buildings," she says. The work is going smoothly and should be completed by this monsoon, Somaya says. Apart from the clock tower, the University library building is also being renovated, for which temporary arrangements have been made in another building in the campus.... contd.
Dr Maya Tulpule still shudders when she recalls her experience as a resident doctor on night duty at a government medical college. "There was a seriously ill patient that I had to treat during the night and I decided to wait in the ladies room. There were tales about how some ward boys used to drink at night on the campus and misbehave. Believe me I was scared as the door did not have a latch. I hope there has been a drastic change in the situation 20 years later," Tulpule, president of the city unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said.Tulpule who set up her own five-bed Sahwaas Hospital at Kothrud preferred to employ women (be it nurses or class IV staff) and ensures that they reach home safely. "In my presidential address that will be circulated to 4,000 IMA member doctors, I have made it a point to refer to the guidelines of the Vishaka committee (against sexual harassment) and directed hospitals/clinics who employ more than 10 workers to set up their internal complaint committee. In 2014, Women's Day in March will be observed in a big way by the IMA," Tulpule said.At the 550-bed Ruby Hall Clinic, one of the largest private hospitals in the city, Code Khatra or Code Yellow, an alert system, has been devised that staffers can utilise in case of any perceived threats. Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic, says that 70 per cent of the staff are women and medical director Dr Sujata Malik who heads the a 'Prevention of Harassment' committee admitted that they often receive complaints.They are not in the nature of molestation. Basically there are complaints based on what has been perceived as undesired or unwanted response from the other person. We have reprimanded the concerned staffers and there is awareness that any kind of harassment will be dealt with. There are 800 nurses out of a staff of 2,500 and care is taken that no single nurse is isolated during duty hours. Dr Manisha Bobade, medical director at Jehangir Hospital, said a grievance committee was set up, which included doctors and medical social workers. It shows that staffers are aware that action will be taken against the errant persons. ... contd.
The mood that night was of party and cheer, but 29-year-old Kavita Deepak Javaldip wore a grim expression. With her hands folded across her chest, she scanned every face with determination, looking for signs of trouble, unrest, or cheating. Wearing all black, the muscles in her arms rippled as she asked for the party-goers for their tickets and vouchers. Javaldip, who is one of the few woman bouncers in the city, knows well about the dos and don'ts of her job."I first started as a security guard, you know, because of my personality," she says, sheepishly. A muscular frame at 5 feet, 9 inches, Javaldip has been working as a bouncer with a group called Man Power Corporate Protection since 2007. "One of the first things we are taught is to be able to speak with our eyes. We hardly ever have to use words; people are intimidated by our steady, no-nonsense gaze," she explains. "It is a good job, but the only complaint I have is a universal one � the salary can be a little more," says Javaldip, who got married in 2010 to a colleague, also a bouncer.While Javaldip uses her gaze as the strongest point, Priya Awate has gained her confidence because of sthe rigourous lessons in kick-boxing, karate and the hours spent at the gym. She too, started off as a security guard, and gradually worked her way up as a bouncer. "I mostly work at high-profile events and year-end parties," she says, adding: "This is the busiest time for us." Awate does not shy away from giving a hand to the needy in times of conflict or fights. "Sometimes I see that a husband is beating up his wife on the road. I go and try to stop him � and succeed too," she says with a smile.... contd.
Downpour during the day and the chilly weather on Tuesday dampened the festivities for the residents and forced them to make alternative arrangements at places where outdoor parties had been planned to usher in the New Year.Rain started on Monday night and continued during the day. This brought down the temperature. The people who were ready to don their party hats to bid adieu to the year 2013 in the open had to rearrange their parties and events inside the premises as the rain struck a dampening note. The major crowd-pulling spots on the New Year eve were Elante Mall, Blue Ice, Sector 17, Hotel Mountview, JW Marriot, Score, Sector 8, Hotel Taj and almost all the resto-bars in Sector 26.Ankit Gupta, director, Human Veritgo Lounge, said, "Because of the cold weather, the bookings and parties at the New Year eve were not as per expectations. Secondly, hotel industry considers Tuesdays as Sundays. These factors proved to be a dampener."The Met Department had predicted rainfall till December 31st night but a clear day from January 1, 2014 onwards. The department has predicted heavy fog in the next two-three days while the temperature may also plummet from Wednesday. The city on Monday recorded the lowest minimum temperature for the month of December at 3.4 degrees, which was three degrees below normal. According to the MeT Department, December 30 was the coldest night of the season.Surinder Paul, director, Meteorological Department, said, "From January 1 onwards, there will be no rain, though the days would be cloudy. The temperature would fall in another three days while there are possibilities of heavy fog too. The fog would give way to clear sky later."
A 22-year-old vegetable vendor was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Tuesday at his residence in Sector 49. While the police claimed that the deceased, Rupinder, had committed suicide, his family is suspecting foul play as he had an affair with his friend's sister, who refused to marry him.Some of Rupinder's neighbours claimed that his hands were tied behind his back when his body was found by his sister-in-law in the morning.  The police officials, however, said that the rope was only wrapped on one hand and that his hands were not tied. Rupinder lived with his wife and elder brother, along with his friend Ravi the Sector 49 house. He had returned from Delhi about a year ago. Both Rupinder and Ravi were working together.Some of his neighbors told Newsline that Rupinder had left house the previous evening to visit a relative in Sector 38. No one saw him coming back after that.According to Sub-Inspector Satbir Singh, police post in-charge, Sector 49, Rupinder was in a relationship with Ravi's sister, who had refused to marry him the previous evening. "After Rupinder's paramour refused to marry him, he went to the vacant room in his house and hung himself from the ceiling fan. A suicide note was found in which he stated that he was responsible for taking his life", SI Satbir Singh said. Police have detained Ravi, his sister and other family member's of Ravi for questioning. "We have recorded the statements and are investigating the case. His parents, who live in Delhi, have been informed. The post mortem examination will be conducted tomorrow, which will ascertain the cause of death," he added.Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Rajesh Shukla said, "Police had taken down body of the deceased after a team by Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory (CFSL) inspected the spot. It seems to be a case of suicide. But we have initiated proceedings under section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)".
Senior deputy mayor Kashmiri Devi did not spend a single rupee of the Rs 20 lakh allocated to her, while deputy mayor Satish Kainth used only Rs 4.16 lakh of the Rs 10 lakh allocated to him. This was revealed in a report of the municipal corporation. The tenure of the mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor ended on Tuesday, with the allocated funds not being fully utilised. Even Mayor Subhash Chawla utilised only Rs 1.75 crore of the Rs 2 crore from the Mayor Development Fund.Councillors of the opposition rue that no money from the Mayor Development Fund was allocated for work in their wards. They alleged that only Congress councillors benefited from the funds.The senior deputy mayor reportedly never attended office and was out of India for several months during the year. Leader of the opposition in the House, councillor Arun Sood said, "The overall performance, when it comes to spending the funds, is poor. The wards of the opposition councillors were completely neglected. Even when it comes to spending the ward development funds, it is the BJP councillors who take the lead," he said.An amount of Rs 40 lakh is allocated to councillors every year for getting work done in their wards. Sood is the only one to have allocated the entire amount. BJP's candidate for the post of mayor, Rajinder Kaur Rattu, allocated only Rs 6.58 lakh for development in her ward. H C Kalyan, mayoral candidate for the Congress, was fared better as he allocated Rs 15.67 lakh for his ward.Mayor Chawla lists highlights of tenureMayor Subhash Chawla listed out his achievements in the past one year on the last day of his term. He claimed that during his tenure, a new overbridge was inaugurated and the construction of a new multi-level parking lot in Sector 17 started. He also stated that a sewerage treatment plant was inaugurated. Also, efforts were made to take stray cattle out of the city.... contd.
The stage is set for the mayoral elections scheduled for January 1, with two candidates in the fray for the mayor's post. H C Kalyan of the Congress will be contesting against Rajinder Kaur Rattu of the BJP-SAD for the post which is reserved this year for a Scheduled Caste candidate. It is the nominated councillors who hold the key to the election.Elections will also be held for the post of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. The candidates continued lobbying on Tuesday to garner support for themselves. Apart from votes of councillors of their own party, the candidates are also approaching the BSP and the nominated councillors to ask for votes.The Congress has fielded Sat Prakash Aggarwal as the candidate for the senior deputy mayor's post. Earlier this year, he was in the race for being fielded by the party as the candidate for the mayor's post. Contesting against him will be Heera Negi, the vice-president of BJP and councillor from ward 21.For the post of deputy mayor, Sheela Phool Singh has been fielded by the Congress. She has been the deputy mayor for two years in the last term of the MC. Facing her is Davesh Moudgil, a councillor of the BJP.In the 36-member House, there are 12 councillors of the Congress, 11 of the BJP-SAD, two of BSP and one Independent. The local MP too has one vote. Apart from them, there are nine nominated councillors who have voting rights. There is difference of just one councillor between the Congress and BJP. The end result hinges on the nominated councillors. These councillors have the numbers to tilt the election to either side.The nominated councillors in this term have extended support to the Congress on all issues. In the past two elections, they have also voted for the Congress candidates. At a meeting of the nominated councillors held a few days back, a decision was taken to support the Congress in these elections as well. The majority of the nominated councillors are expected to do so. This would give the Congress an edge over the BJP-SAD.... contd.
Private and mini bus operators' associations in West Bengal Tuesday announced that they will hold a one-day "token" strike on January 6 demanding fare revision."The decision was taken after a meeting of five bus and mini bus operators' associations here during the day", vice-president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, Dipak Sarkar said.The strike call comes a day after state transport minister Madan Mitra ruled out any hike in bus fares."When diesel prices are rising on a regular basis, how can bus fares be controlled?" Sarkar asked.Besides the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, the Minibus operator's Coordination Committee and the All Bengal Bus and Mini Bus Co-ordination Committee, Howrah have also supported the strike call, he said.Private bus operators have been demanding a fare hike to cope with increasing operational costs and a substantial rise in fuel price.Addressing a press conference here yesterday, state transport minister Madan Mitra had said it was not correct on the part of the bus operators to claim that the existing fare structure was not viable."Any hike in bus fares is not on the government's agenda," Mitra had told reporters.
Days ahead of the January 5 general elections in neighbouring Bangladesh, Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami Tuesday reviewed security on the Indo-Bangla border, which would be sealed during the polls and also discussed various issues including BSF's demand for land to set up battalion headquarters and border outposts. Goswami also held a meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and met senior security officials, including those of the state government."We discussed law and order situation of the state among other matters. The state government asked for funds (for different projects) and we told them to send us project reports," Goswamy, who came to Kolkata on a special BSF flight, said after the meeting. He returned to Delhi in the evening.Mamata, however, described it as a routine meeting saying they discussed the border situation. Asked whether Bangladesh elections and the situation there came up for discussions, she said: "Why should I talk about the internal matters of another country?"According to sources the projects for which the state government asked for funds included modernisation and special infrastructure scheme for the state police, border fencing and building up of more coastal police stations, to name a few.State Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee, however, said that 80 per cent of the meeting was devoted to the border with Bangladesh in view of the elections in the neighbouring country."Elections are scheduled to be held (in Bangladesh) on January 5. He (Goswamy) asked for a detailed report about the situation along the border and the steps being taken. The border along Bangladesh is going to be sealed," Banerjee saidAnother issue that came up during the meeting was a surrender package for KLO militants, in the line of the package given by the central government to surrendered Maoists. "One of the state government officials broached the subject and the Union Home Secretary said the Centre would consider it," a top central government official told The Indian Express.... contd.
The last of the hockey icons, Balbir Singh Sr turned 90 on Tuesday, looking back with satisfaction at his long and rewarding tryst with hockey, which he calls his "first love", but sad at the state of the game in India.Gentle and soft-spoken as ever, ramrod straight Balbir belies his years. Triple gold Olympian and a victorious Olympic captain, he was also the chief coach and manager of the team that won the one and only World Cup hockey title for India in 1975.Chosen as one of the 16 'iconic Olympians' across all disciplines since 1896, the start of the modern Olympic era, Balbir was honoured by the International Olympic Committee during the 2012 London Olympics along with other great sportsmen such as legendary sprinter the late Jesse Owens.Balbir remains the holder of Olympic and world record for the most goals scored by an individual in an Olympic men's hockey final for scoring 5 out of the 6 goals against Holland in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. He captained the Indian team that won the title in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.Despite an outstanding career, Balbir remains a modest man and has to be coaxed into talking about his achievements. 'I was very lucky', he says.He calls hockey 'my Goddess, my first love and my darling'. He is still waiting for his 'hockey fairy' who would help India regain its glory in the game. Asked about the state of Indian hockey, Balbir replies, "Very bad. I did not want to say this word. I feel dejected. I am sad,"He recalled that when he was being honoured during the London Olympics, the Indian team had not won a single match which had shocked him. "Balbir comes and Balbir goes but India is there forever. It is India which is more important". ... contd.
A woman was allegedly stabbed and set on fire by a group of men, including a village sarpanch, in Ganjam district of Orissa on Monday evening. She succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday. Pranati Das (30), an owner of a public distribution system (PDS) shop, was at home in Sanaramchandrapur village in Rambha area of Ganjam on Monday when she was called out by two men. When she came out, "five people, including the sarpanch of the Sanaramchandrapur grampanchayat, stabbed her with a sword, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire," Ganjam SP Ashish Kumar Singh said. "She had shut her shop by 7 pm. There was a power-cut in the area and people were in their homes when the incident happened," he said.Das, who lived alone, was taken to MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town with more than 95 per cent burn injuries. As her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to a hospital in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh where she succumbed to her injuries Tuesday morning.The SP said the woman had, in her dying statement, accused the sarpanch of trying to get ownership of her shop. "There clearly was lot of  bad blood between the two. From her house, we recovered a couple of threatening letters from him (the sarpanch), asking her to to give up the dealership of the shop.""It would have been difficult for us to nab the accused had the woman not revealed their names in her dying statement. We have arrested four of the 5 accused. The case would be put up for fast-track trial," he said.
While he can look back and say 2012 was a nightmare, Manan Vohra will end 2013 on a very happy note. Injuries and bad luck had been plaguing the Chandigarh-based opener last year, but when he got his chances this time, he didn't let them go. As he slammed a career-best 187 against Jharkhand in the last league match and gave Punjab a good chance of making it to the knockouts of Ranji Trophy this season, Manan reposed the faith shown in him by the state selectors. Till now, Manan has scored 343 runs in the four matches he has played so far and his batting may have also solved the jigsaw puzzle that was the Punjab opening pair. Manan has had to work hard for the results. A knee injury had kept him out of cricket but he used the off season to work both on his batting as well as physical fitness. He hit back-to-back centuries for Punjab in the C K Nayuddu Under-25 tournament and that was enough for the selectors to usher him into the Ranji XI. In his comeback match against Vidarbha, Manan scored an impressive 52 runs in the second innings. He could have easily made a hundred seeing the confidence in his batting but he got run out. In the next match against Karnataka, while all struggled against the opposition bowlers, Manan stood tall and scored 69 runs in the first innings at Hubli. Although, Punjab lost the match, Manan did leave a mark. But he gave glimpse of his talent when he played a commendable innings of 187 runs against Jharkhand in the first innings, laying a firm platform for Punjab. Jharkhand being 210 for 9 at the end of the second day's play in their first-innings, puts Punjab in a commanding position in the match. ... contd.
Dr Kanu Kalsariya, former BJP MLA from Mahuva, who successfully spearheaded the public agitation against Nirma group's proposed cement plant in Bhavnagar district, is likely to join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Gujarat. Kalsariya who lost the Assembly elections last December which he fought under an independent banner, has been motivated to join the fledgling party after its stunning Delhi win.Following its victory in the capital,  AAP has seen a flurry of registration of members in the state, but Kalsariya joining the party is likely to prove a shot in the arm of the party in Gujarat. He is also likely to bag a key post in AAP, say sources. When contacted on him joining AAP, Kalsariya said, "I am seriously churning the idea of joining AAP along with my supporters. We are considering that on emergency scale and will take a decision in this regard by tomorrow."A general surgeon from Bhavnagar, Kalsariya has been the face of the farmers' agitation in Gujarat which also caused a lot of embarrassment to the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government. It was the farmers' agitation under Kalsariya's leadership that has so far kept the Nirma's cement plant away from Mahuva of Bhavnagar district. Union Government's Ministry of Environment & Forest (MoEF) has revoked the sanction granted to the project and a litigation in this regard is on at National Green Tribunal.Incidentally, Arvind Kejriwal had supported a similar agitation against land acquisition for setting up the Raksha Shakti University in Lavad village of Gandhinagar district in 2012. The villagers were protesting that it was pastoral land. Although Kalsariya had openly revolted against the BJP-ruled Gujarat government by supporting farmers' cause across the state, the BJP did not suspend or dismiss Kalsariya. In fact, in the 2012 Assembly elections, Kalsariya fought elections under the banner of his group called Sadbhavna Manch from Gariadhar constituency of Bhavnagar. He, however, lost badly to a BJP candidate.... contd.
BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's next stop for his Vijay Shakhnad rally � scheduled for January 13 � is Muslim-dominated Bareilly where workers are busy hunting for a sprawling ground. The BJP state unit has crossed out Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan where Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav held his rally on November 21 for reason that the party is expecting a "crowd of more than five lakh".BJP national general secretary and UP in-charge Amit Shah, after finalising the schedule for Modi's upcoming rallies, however, did confirm that the party has decided upon Smriti Upwan as the venue for the January 13 rally. "The Ambedkar maidan is smaller than Smriti Upwan. As we are expecting a crowd of more than five lakh, the venue has been changed to Smriti Upwan, spread over 80 acres," a party leader said. Modi will next hold a rally in Gorakhpur, the date for which will be decided today, followed by a rally in Meerut on February 1. According to Shah, a mega state-level rally has been planned for Lucknow in March. Bareilly has five Lok Sabha and 26 Assembly constituencies. Of these, the BJP managed to win two seats � Pilibhit and Aonla � in 2009 general elections and five seats in 2012 Assembly elections. The western UP belt is crucial for BJP as the party sends five of its 10 MPs and 20 of its total 47 MLAs from this region. Also, with Jats comprising a major chunk, the party is expecting a strong polarisation of the community votes to work in its favour in the backdrop of Muzaffarnagar riots. Earlier, Shah held a meeting with the state office-bearers and reviewed the progress of fund collection, which has been going on for the past several months. Sources said the programme to create a corpus fund of Rs 50 crore for the organisation's routine expenditure, has been extended till March 31.  
Almost a decade after the city police gunned him down in a round of retaliatory fire, the encounter of Kashyap Dhaka is now being probed by a team of the Special Task Force (STF). The officers, who reconstructed the encounter site near the Narmada canal in Harni on Tuesday, will submit their report to the Gujarat HC. Officers of STF arrived in the city from Ahmedabad on Tuesday and visited the site where the encounter had taken place in August 14, 2004. In August 2004, Dhaka was taken to Harni canal area by police to recover the firearms that he had supposedly hidden there. He was shot dead in the retaliatory fire by police inspector G V Desai and sub-inspector D D Damor. CN Rajput, Investigating officer, who visited the Harni Canal area, said, "We are investigating the encounter as per the court directions. " Dhaka was brought to Vadodara on August 9, 2004 on a transfer warrant from Jodhpur police, where he was arrested for vehicle thefts. 
The Jalpaiguri blast that killed six people last week could have been averted had the West Bengal Police acted on intelligence inputs it received from the central and state agencies.As per the sources in the police, the department had received three intelligence inputs a week ahead of the December 26 blast, alerting the security forces about a platoon of Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) commanders entering the Jalpaiguri town and hatching a terror plot. However, the security forces sat on the inputs. The intelligence inputs suggested that senior KLO leaders were present in Malda and Jalpaiguri to execute terror activities. The outfit, which was not taken seriously by the Bengal Police in last few years, is now said to have  considerable fire power. The cartridges, recovered from a spot in Malda where more than 10 rounds were fired at a public bus recently, belong to sophisticated assault rifle of a senior KLO leader, said a senior official of the state forensic department. "We have information that Malkhan Singh alias Madhab Mondal � a military chief in the KLO � was present at the spot when the shots were fired. The assault rifle belongs to him. However, he has now left the region," said a senior police official.Meanwhile, the police arrested one more person in connection with the bicycle bomb blast.Superintendent of Police Amit P Javalgi said Dipankar Singh, a KLO linkman, was picked up from Kharibari area of neighbouring Darjeeling district, taking the total number of arrests in this connection to three.Earlier, general secretary of Kamtapur People's Party (KPP) central committee, Nubas Burman, was arrested on December 29 from his home at Toofanganj in Cooch Behar while another man, Chandan Roy was arrested from Moynaguri in Jalpaiguri in connection with the December 26 blast. KPP is the political offshoot of the KLO. ... contd.
A day after seven shops in the congested Mangal Bazar were gutted in fire, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is awaiting a report from the Fire Department to plan the decongestion of the market area. On Monday, a fire started in one of the plastic shops in the market which spread through seven shops along the line and took about 13 fire tenders to douse the flames. Vadodara Municipal Commissioner Manish Bharadwaj said that the decision on the market area will be taken after the probe report reaches the VMC. "We have found that the shops had all legal documents and permissions to run their business. But it is absolutely essential to rethink about the market area as it could have been worse if the fire had occurred in one of the interior lanes or in the night with no one to spot it immediately. We will certainly give a thought to bringing in measures to prevent such tragedies once the report reaches us in a couple of days."The fire probe has been handed over to the police, which is now awaiting the report from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to ascertain the cause of fire. An officer from the city police station said, "The FSL team has collected samples from the fire site and will submit its findings after which action will be taken against anyone whose negligence may have caused the fire." Officials admit that fire in the shops that make the narrow lanes of the market would be difficult to douse. Chief Fire officer Hitesh Taparia said, "There are narrow lanes in all market areas in India and abroad. It is not practical to think that market lanes will be 12-feet wide roads. What should be our best plan is to mitigate the risk and minimise the problem."
A 16-year-old girl, who was gangraped twice in a day around two months ago at Madhyamgram in North 24-Parganas district of West Bengal and had attempted suicide on December 23, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital here Tuesday. The victim was admitted to the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata with 70 per cent burn injuries after she attempted self-immolation in her house near Dum Dum, where her family had shifted after the rape incidents at Madhyamgram.A gang of men raped the girl on October 25 near her house. Later, the same day, when she was returning home along with her father, who is a taxi driver, and her mother after lodging a complaint with the local police station, she was again abducted by the same gang and raped, police said.The severely injured victim was found lying unconscious near the railway tracks on the same day.The family, originally from Samastipur in Bihar, had settled in Madhyamgram a year ago. However, they shifted to Dum Dum after some local goons threatened them with dire consequences if they didn't withdraw the case against the accused. On December 23, a close associate of the gang leader had barged into their Dum Dum residence and again threatened them following which the girl tried to commit suicide the same day.Meanwhile, father of the victim alleged that his daughter was not given proper medical treatment at the hospital. "We repeatedly requested the hospital authorities to shift her to the burn unit at PG hospital. But they did not pay attention to us," the victim's father said, adding that he has also lodged a case of medical negligence against the hospital authorities. The father said nobody from the government visited the family. "We want justice and we want that the criminals should be hanged," the father added.... contd.
Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane couldn't stop staring at Sachin Tendulkar like a million others when the little master gave his last speech during his farewell Test at the Wankhede Stadium. Then they reverentially walked up to him and requested for a parting photograph in the dressing room.While emotions ran high, for many it was the end of cricket. Tendulkar not only inspired the Ajinkya-Rohit pair to choose cricket but had given them a reason to love the sport over everything else too. As Tendulkar took a final lap of the Wankhede Stadium, many wondered who would carry the mantle of Mumbai's legendary batsmanship forward. "Who next?" everyone thought on that November afternoon.A month on � though a tad early to say this � two men in their mid-20s are taking giant strides to fill the boots of Tendulkar, donning Indian colours and going about cementing their places in the national team. It surely is a tough task for the youngsters to carry on with the legacy of Mumbai's batting great. However, if their outings in 2013 are any indication, the pair is ensuring that Mumbai doggedness and flair are qualities that get represented with team India.  It is as if the maestro's most prized qualities � stylish strokeplay and fighting determination - were split into two juniors, with Sharma carrying the gene of style and Rahane of substance. One look at 2013 and Rohit certainly looks like he has been on a dream run. Of the 28 ODIs played this year, Rohit averages 52 with 1196 runs. He scored a double (206) in an ODI against Australia (only the third in the world to) and with two hundreds and eight fifties this season, Rohit established himself as an opener in the limited -overs format. A Test debut followed soon after the double and he scored 177 on debut followed by a 111 in Mumbai against West Indies. Under his captaincy, Mumbai Indians clinched their maiden title followed by the Champions League and it was his leadership quality too that came to the fore thereafter.... contd.
Despite outnumbering men in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies, women corporators are an unhappy lot. Reason: they have not been given a free hand in decision-making process. They might have a point, but officials and activists, argue that women corporators are themselves to blame for their plight as many of them o not actively participate in raising public issues inside civic general body meetings or even on public platforms.Following the state government's decision to reserve 50 per cent wards for women, as many as 78 women corporators made it to the 152-member PMC general body in the last elections. In PCMC, 65 women corporators were elected in the house of 128 corporators."Things have hardly changed in local politics as men take a call on all important issues and women corporators have to accept that," said Vaishali Marathe, chairperson of Women and Child Welfare Committee."The civic administration does not take us seriously and it can be made out from the poor attendance in the committee meetings," Marathe said, adding, the members had to take up the issue with the municipal commissioner and threaten to resign if the situation prevailed.PMC Congress corporator and state Congress chief Kamal Vyavhare said that there is not much attention given to the good work done by us. "We need more publicity to highlight our work. The lack of recognition for good work is not encouraging to women who are performing well in politics," she said.However, former Pune mayor Rajlaxmi Bhosale said if a person has the capability then no one can stop them from making their presence felt. "The women corporators have to blame themselves for their situation. Most women corporators are there because the ward has become reserved and male member cannot contest. Thus, they are incapable of taking decision and go by what they are told," she said.... contd.
With New Year come new hopes and promises. In case of Cooperage football ground, though, it has been a case of renewed hope and the same old promises. This year, the wait shall finally end. After nearly three years of delays and false assurances, Mumbai's only football venue will be operational again, come February.Watching a football match at the Cooperage was more dangerous than delightful. The rickety stands at the traditionally uninspiring venue quivered at every step you took. There was a risk of it falling apart every time someone stood up and cheered for a goal. The hard surface with dry grass sprinkled across the centre circle was a torture on the players' knees and produced poor quality football. Ironically, the lifeless venue continued to remain one of the most sought after addresses to hold wedding receptions. It still is. However, it's gotten slightly better for football as well.The wobbly wooden planks have made way for sturdy steel stands imported from China. The yellow-and-blue patterned bucket seats add colour to the venue, quite literally, and a lush green artificial turf has replaced the natural surface. FIFA had granted $2.5 million (roughly Rs 12 crore) for the refurbishment of the stadium. But the falling rupee and bureaucratic delays have resulted in WIFA overshooting the budget by at least Rs 1 crore.They won't mind that, though. Ever since Cooperage, the home of Mumbai football, went for renovation, the sport died a slow death in the city. With no other playable ground in the city, Mumbai-based clubs had to play their I-League matches in Pune and Kolhapur while the Elite Division league had to be scrapped twice. Mumbai Tigers, a newly-formed club owned by a Dubai-based NRI, pulled out of the I-League despite getting a direct entry because there was nowhere to play in Mumbai. ... contd.
Women have been making their presence felt in the teaching field in Pune for long. According to the District Information System for Education (DISE), as on May 2013, the state of Maharasthra has 2,97,480 female teachers working various educational institutions. This amounts to more than 43 per cent of the total 6,91,038  teachers employed in 1,03,625 schools and junior colleges across the state. In Pune district, more than 60 per cent of total 53,397 teachers are women. As many as 32,427 female teachers have been working in more than 6,849 educational institutes up to higher secondary level, the DISE data reveals. According to education department officials, the number of female teachers in teaching profession has been steady over the past few years with retention rate relatively high compared to other professions. Varsha Sharma, principal of Abhinav English Medium School, Ambegaon, who has been in the profession for over 15 years, said flexible job timings and limited working hours make the profession one of the most sought after jobs by women."Teaching is also a safer profession. Women can go home and be with their families by evening. Besides, it is a noble profession indeed, which shapes young minds and inculcate values and principles in next generation. Being part of this noble work gives you immense job satisfaction," she said.Sharma said issues of women safety associated with other jobs are not present in the teaching profession. "In other jobs, women employees are generally a minority, but in teaching it is not so. For example in our case, we have more than 120 lady employees, including non-teaching staffers in a staff of total around 135. In our secondary education section, 45 teachers are women out of total teaching staff of 50," she said.While the school-level education system has firmly women at its forefront, the same is not true when it comes to higher education sector. In this area, women teachers still face gender bias and are often denied top posts. Educationist Dr A L Deshmukh said most of the female teachers have been facing difficulties in tackling with negative behavioral changes in students. "Today's young generation are more aggressive and have a set of different values influenced by the process of globalisation. Every teacher is finding it difficult to deal with the changes in students and female teachers are especially worried. Certain provisions in the RTE Act have tied up teachers' hands, when it comes to resorting to stringent punishment," he said.... contd.
Women officers and constables in the city police said they do not feel insecure and they do get  support from their male counterparts . However, they said they do not get challenging assignments compared to their male counterparts. "A woman police officer has to prove her skills and take initiative if she wants to be a part of any special or challenging task. Whereas, there are many male police officers who are chosen for such tasks without their skills being considered," said a senior female police officer.She said, "There have been officers like Meeran Borwankar who have handled top posts like Pune police commissioner. So, even though the number of females in the police department is much less than males, there is enough scope for those with a "go-getter" attitude. Working in police department is a satifying job. And if you show initiative, you are certainly rewarded."In the 8,000-strong city police force, there are nearly 1,500 females, including one ACP, nine police inspectors, 46 assistant inspectors, 73 sub inspectors, 16 assistant sub inspectors and 1,135 constables.ACP Smita Patil, who is heads the Chatuhrshrungi division, is the senior-most female officer in the city police. There is no police station having a female senior inspector. Earlier, senior inspector Sushma Chavan was in-charge of the Cantonment police station. She is now with the cyber crime and economic offences wing (EOW) of city police. Besides, female officers are handling key responsibilities like inspector Smita Jadhav, in-charge of Women's Grievance Redressal Cell, inspector Neelam Jadhav, in-charge of Deccan and Shivajinagar traffic division. Female officers and constables are deployed in all branches and police stations of city.Some of the female officers and constables said they also work on night duties with their male counterparts and there have been no serious problems related to their security and safety. ACP (administration) Abdur Rehman said, "We have a committee to check harassment of female cops at work place. Any female cop can approach and complaint to this panel."... contd.
Opening batsman Chris Rogers wants an unchanged Australian team for the fifth and final Ashes test as a reward for the eleven players who beat England in the first four matches to emphatically wrest back the urn.The hosts have played with the same team since the start of the series in November and they will head to Sydney eyeing a whitewash when the match starts on Friday. "We've had some good stability," Rogers, who struck a sparkling century to fire Australia to a dominant eight-wicket win in the fourth Ashes test, told reporters on Tuesday."I just think it would be nice to have that same 11 standing on the podium at the end. The guys who have been here this whole series deserve to be there so it would be nice if we can keep that same team."Paceman Ryan Harris and all-rounder Shane Watson bowled sparingly in the second innings in Melbourne as they managed respective knee and groin complaints but are expected to be fit for Sydney.Australia lost 3-0 in the year's first Ashes series in England and few would have seen the reversal Down Under.Off-spinner Nathan Lyon said the hosts' ruthless performance did not come as a surprise to him and he also expected to be part of an unchanged Australia team. "We knew it was coming to be honest," Lyon said, adding that Australia were thinking nothing other than winning the series 5-0. "Yes England beat us over there 3-0 but it was a lot closer over there."We had opportunities but we fell over at the line and here in Australia we've won the bigger moments and won them pretty well."It's been a big reward for what we went through in England."  Meanwhile Andy Flower has said he'll be telling the new England Cricket Board managing director when they meet this week that he wants to continue contributing as a national coach despite the Ashes series debacle in Australia.... contd.
Deputy Commissioner - Rajat AggarwalThe song Bach ke rehna re baba...is apt for DC Rajat Aggarwal, who has earned the label of a strict administrator from his subordinates. Aggarwal keeps a hawk's eye on all the work shirkers and forced all late comers to be on time. Though he took charge in the last quarter of 2013, in Ludhiana, he earned the support of senior citizens, especially for his project which spoke about their rights. It sent out a strong message to those who do not take good care of their parents. MC Commissioner - Rahul TewariIdhar chala main udhar chala, jaane kahaan main kidhar chala... must be how Municipal Corporation Commissioner Rahul Tewari felt, before he was finally appointed to his present post. While first he was transferred from the post of Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) to  Amritsar DC, recently there was news of him being appointed the new CA of GLADA. However, finally he was made the MC Commissioner.Police Commissioner - Nirmal Singh DhillonKnown for his cool approach while handling even the tough cases, Commissioner Nirmal Singh Dhillon succeeds in pacifying angry complainants soon. One this he is not happy about is the the traffic congestion in this city as he himself has got stuck in traffic jams a number of times. Therefore, apart from maintaining law and order, he believes that managing the traffic properly will solve more than 50 per cent of the problems in the city.CA GLADA - R K VermaSenior IAS officer R K Verma, who is now Chief Administrator of Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA), can be called an IT buff. During his previous posting as MC Commissioner, Ludhiana, or his present post for that matter, he is always available to media on popular apps and in case he is stuck in a meeting, one can leave questions on his app and there is no doubt that he will not reply. ... contd.
While some residents went to clubs and hotels, many preferred to listen to kirtan at mandirs and gurdwaras to welcome the new year. Special prayers were also organised at some religious organisations in the memory of the recent acid attack victim Harpreet Kaur, who succumbed to her injuries on December 27 in a Mumbai hospital.At Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib, a special kirtan darbar was organised in the morning, which continued till noon. Pritpal Singh, president of the gurdwara management committee, said, "We organise kirtan darbars every year and this year our hearts are heavy because of the death of acid attack victim Harpreet, who died a few days ago. Last year we had organised a special prayer meeting for the Delhi gangrape victim. This year too, we will pray for the departed soul.""We will pray that the next year ends on a happy note and heinous crimes against women come to an end," he added.In the coming days, the administration plans to organise a seminar, focusing on women security. Students of Kamla Lohtia college also took out a road rally for women security, while Shaheed Sukhdev Thaper memorial trust urged people to refrain from new year celebrations because of the unfortunate incident of the acid attack.For those willing to party, and spend, clubs and hotels left no stone unturned to attract as many as they could. Dine and dance parties were in hotel Raddisson Blu, where an all-girls band had been brought in to perform at the coffee shop. For Rs 4,999, one could enjoy unlimited food and drinks, apart from the performance of the band. New year parties were also organised at Darbar Hall and Terrace Grill at Park Plaza, where singers from Voice of Punjab had been invited.Fortune Park Klassik also organised a party for food lovers, while dance parties were organised at Sutlej Club, Lodhi Club and Ludhiana Club for their members.
In what seemed like an effort to distance himself from the Congress party on the eve of the new Assembly session, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday called his minority AAP government a "48-hour" government. Kejriwal's remarks came in response to a query on whether his government was anxious about the confidence motion on the floor of the House on January 2. "It is not we who are fearful, I am only letting you know what I have been hearing. We do not know politics, we are the 'aam aadmi'. We are hearing rumours from the BJP and the Congress camps. For 48 hours, we will serve the 'janta'," Kejriwal said. But even as the chief minister called his government a short-term one, his Cabinet ministers went about their work as usual. Education Minister Manish Sisodia attended a function at a government school and later held a long meeting with senior officials while Transport Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had a meeting with the secretary. Women and Child Welfare Minister Rakhi Birla went about visiting various shelters for the homeless. SC/ST and Employment Minister Girish Soni met his officials, while  Law Minister Somnath Bharti kept the law secretary on his toes, demanding files and information on how the system works. In a major move indicating change in government stance on important legal issues, the AAP government has decided to change its entire team of law officers. Maintaining that the department is in ICU, Law Minister Somnath Bharti on Tuesday said the lawyers who have been induced in the panel on political recommendations would be shown the door. In a meeting with the law secretary, Bharti reviewed the process of appointment of public prosecutors on Delhi government panel in criminal and civil class. Bharti also called the secretary to access litigation budget in which he found discrepancies. "There are no exact budget reports on how much our standing counsels are paid and what their performance level is. I have been briefed about the quality of the standing counsels that we have and the department will go for a major restructuring," Bharti said. ... contd.
Consensus seems to have been achieved regarding the pro-tem speaker with both the Congress and the Aam Admi Party (AAP) settling on the candidature of Congress leader Mateen Ahmed. But on the eve of the new Assembly session, the Congress kept the AAP guessing on support for its Speaker candidate, M S Dhir of Jangpura.Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung had appointed senior BJP leader and Janakpuri MLA Jagdish Mukhi as pro-tem Speaker of the Delhi Assembly on Monday. But late Monday, leader of the BJP legislative party Harsh Vardhan conveyed to the Lt-Governor that the party had declined Mukhi's nomination. By Tuesday, JD(U) MLA Shoaib Iqbal � whose name had also been suggested � also said a polite no.The ensuing drama ended when the Congress proposed the name of Congress MLA of Seelampur Mateen Ahmed as pro-tem Speaker. "The DPCC chief Arvinder Singh Lovely contacted Mateen Ahmed for the post of pro-tem speaker of the Delhi Assembly and it has been decided that he will be the pro-tem speaker," Shakeel Ahmed, AICC general secretary-in-charge of Delhi, said.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced to the media outside his house that even though the BJP and the Congress have been quiet about their strategy with regard to their choice of candidate for the post of Speaker, their party's candidate would be MS Dhir.But both the Congress and the BJP continued to remain reticent about their choice of Speaker. Senior Congress leaders said the decision regarding whether or not to support M S Dhir hasn't been taken yet. Harsh Vardhan told Newsline, "We have not yet decided whether or not we will fight the election for the Speaker or not."Sources in the Congress said even though the party is not officially endorsing Dhir's candidature, it is likely to and its reticence in declaring support is part of its policy to keep 'AAP in line'. ... contd.

The Aam Aadmi Party's government on Tuesday announced that it would be issuing 15,000 autorickshaw permits to those belonging to the SC/ST and OBC categories. Of the 45,000 new permits allowed to be issued by the Supreme Court, only a few permits have been allotted under this category till date. "The government is committed to the cause of autorickshaw drivers and the SC/ST community. The idea is to provide self employment to them. At present, most of the autorickshaws are under the control of a cartel and the drivers employed by them have to pay the owners exorbitant rents. This move of providing permits to the SC/ST and OBC category will help break this nexus,'' Transport Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj said.According to the transport department, only 1,300 permits have been issued to drivers under this category even though there is a provision to issue nearly 14,000 permits under the category.Bhardwaj had earlier said 5,500 autorickshaws will be given inter-state permits. These 5,500 autorickshaws are part of 7,000 autorickshaws in the NCR cluster scheme, which is under litigation. While 5,500 individual permits will be issued soon, around 1,500 auto permits will be kept aside till the case is settled, Bhardwaj said.When questioned on how he would clamp down on the autorickshaw cartel, Bhardwaj said the number of autorickshaws plying on the road would have to be increased."We need to add more autorickshaws in a phased manner keeping in mind parameters such as traffic congestion and pollution,'' he said. There are 55,000 autorickshaws plying in Delhi at present and another 45,000 were allowed to be given permits by the Supreme Court.Incidentally, the Delhi government had gone to court six months ago with the proposal of allowing more autorickshaws but it was put on hold by the Supreme Court, which said the state must fill up the OBC/SC/ST quota before seeking more autorickshaws.
With rising prices taking centrestage in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections, one of the promises made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in its manifesto was that it would take steps to control the escalating prices of essentialcommodities. With the AAP taking charge on Saturday, the party said it plans to discuss the issue of rising prices in mohalla sabhas in the coming months.According to the AAP, it was necessary to deliberate on such issues with the 'aam aadmi' so that they are aware of why they are paying a certain price for such commodities and what can be done to control the prices.When asked if the issue of price rise would be taken up in mohalla sabhas, Pankaj Gupta, member of AAP's political affairs committee, said, "Yes, why not? We have to put facts in front of the public so that they understand the reasons behind the pricing of commodities and the reason behind price rise. The idea is to provide all the facts to people so that there can be a discussion... The response we get from the mohalla sabhas will help us make our policy decisions related to pricing.""This will also help expose monopolies, if any. Now, there are a lot of companies which are earning huge profits because they sell goods at inflated rates. This needs to be checked. At present, such facts are not available in the public domain," an AAP member said.The manifesto of the party states: "Today, prices of all things are increasing, like onions, tomatoes, water, power or the school fees of children... For the common man, the issue of price rise is related to essential commodities required by them... The complete solution of price rise cannot be found without changing the policies of the central government but the state government can take some steps to improve the situation..."... contd.
He parks his two-wheeler wherever he wishes. Rules like stopping when the signal turns red, driving within speed limits or wearing a helmet mean nothing to him. Whenever he is stopped by a traffic policeman, he gladly accepts the challan receipt, pockets it and zooms off, only to break another set of traffic rules.The rider, in a span of four months, has committed 144 violations � a record of all the violations is stored in the e-challan system. But the violator remains untraceable as he has a temporary registration number plate, police said.Four months after an e-challan machine, which keeps a record of all offenders, was put to use, the data collected by the Delhi Traffic Police shows that motorists in Delhi are habitual offenders. According to data, 1,968 motorists are repeat offenders. Of them, 150 drivers have repeated an offence more than eight times."The top three violators � the two-wheeler owner with 144 violations, another with 85 violations and the third with 59 violations � have temporary registration numbers. Among car drivers, the top offender has 17 challans against him," Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Shukla said.According to police, one of the reasons to put in place the e-challan machine was to catch repeat offenders. "Earlier, we had no record of habitual offenders... Now, we have but we do not have the power to cancel the driving licences of these violators. The power lies with the Transport authorities. All we can do is issue challans," a senior traffic officer said.The traffic police is now planning to send a list of the top 50 offenders to the Transport department, so that their licences can be cancelled.Along with this, police may also write to insurance companies, requesting them to increase the premium paid by the offenders. "These offenders will be classified as 'risky drivers' and we are planning to write to the insurance companies and the Transport department in this regard. The matter needs to be dealt with a heavy hand," a police officer said.
Education Minister Manish Sisodia has welcomed the new nursery guidelines, saying it will help make the current education system transparent. Calling them "forward-looking and progressive", the minister said the new guidelines will go a long way in "putting necessary pressure on private schools to keep the admission procedure clean and transparent"."The new guidelines are quite progressive and forward-looking. We view it as a step in the right direction, one that will put pressure on schools to keep their admission process clean. However, a lot more needs to be done and we are committed to doing that," Sisodia said.He especially hailed the scrapping of management quota, saying that the move would help end the culture of donation prevalent in city's private schools. On his plans of making nursery admissions transparent, he said his agenda was to make the process "parent-friendly"."We will ask private schools to make a chart and post it online on their websites. We will ask them to identify the radius of their geographical area of six to eight kilometres accurately, put the fee details and the number of students in every class clearly on the websites so that parents should be able to compare," he had said, in an earlier interaction with Newsline.The decision on nursery admission criteria was taken byLt-Governor Najeeb Jung at the insistence of the High Court. The decision has not found favour with private schools, which are now thinking of challenging the L-G's order in the High Court.But before approaching the court, school authorities are now planning to approach Sisodia and Kejriwal to "present their side of the story" in the next couple of days."The government has only heard one side of the story so far. We would like to go and meet both the education minister and the new CM to apprise them about the interests of private schools. We would like to inform them about the demerits of the guidelines, and how it harms private schools' interests," S K Bhattacharya, chairman, action committee of Private Unaided Recognised Schools, said.... contd.
A notification to do away with use of red beacons by officials or ministers in the Delhi government is likely to be issued in a day or two. This was one of the first announcements made by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after he joined office."The required approval for this has been received from the L-G's office and a notification will be issued by the Transport department in this regard in a day or two. Only police vehicles, fire tenders, ambulances etc will be allowed to use red beacons thereafter. Red beacons have been removed from most government vehicles soon after the announcement," an official said.The Supreme Court had, in fact, in a recent judgement slammed the blatant misuse of red beacons and had directed the government to revise their usage.Besides doing away with the red beacons, other measures announced by the AAP to do away with the 'VIP culture' included doing away with personal security officers provided to officials. None of the Cabinet ministers have taken government vehicles or bungalows also. Kejriwal himself has refused to take up a sprawling bungalow at Lutyens zone and a guesthouse near Rajghat is being considered for his new residence.While Minister of SC/ST and Employment Girish Soni said he was planning to drive to work on his own, Minister for Women and Child Development Rakhi Birla was seen coming to the Secretariat in an auto-rickshaw on Monday.The AAP government has been moving fast towards fulfilling its promises made in its manifesto. The AAP has already provided 700 litres of free water daily to each household and, on Tuesday, announced the reduction of power tariff in the city.
With the Lok Sabha polls just five months away, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to fast-forward its candidate-selection process. Following a meeting of the AAP's political affairs committee (PAC) within two weeks, the party will announce the names and the number of Lok Sabha seats in which the AAP will field candidates, party leaders said."There is not enough time to follow the candidate selection procedure as laid down by the party during the Delhi Assembly elections. We don't have time to go through several rounds of screening like we did for the Delhi elections � we won't be putting the list of shortlisted names on the website. In less than 15 days, a meeting of the political affairs committee will be held on the issue," senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said.Elaborating on the nature of the candidate-selection process for Lok Sabha polls, Singh said, "There are two ways in which we are deciding candidates for the Lok Sabha polls. People are approaching us � either downloading the form from our website or visiting our district and state-level offices to submit their applications."Moreover, the AAP has also constituted committees to identify prospective candidates for the upcoming general elections in the country. Singh emphasised that only such candidates who stand by the party's values and beliefs will be considered by the PAC.While the AAP is expected to field candidates in at least 22 states, states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Northeast states might not see AAP faces in the Lok Sabha polls."Some states have a strong party presence while others like Jammu & Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal do not have a strong party unit. We are strengthening the existing state units," Singh said.He also said that the party will focus on Lok Sabha seats in urban areas. "We will concentrate on urban areas but reserved seats will also be contested," Singh said.... contd.
A day after vowing to fight corruption at a function held at Jantar Mantar, the Congress promised to embark on a 'jan andolan' if the AAP fails to keep its promises within the next two months."The Congress is not in a hurry. We have given them 60 days to come true on their promises. But if everyone in Delhi doesn't receive the promised 700 litres of free, potable water, then we will take to the streets and embark upon a massive jan andolan," former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma said.The Congress also said the AAP through its promises regarding water had cheated the people of Delhi.Sharma alleged that the move would not benefit those living in unauthorised and resettlement colonies, villages and group housing societies."Only those with working meters will benefit from this move. Those in group housing societies and unauthorised colonies and those living in DDA, NDMC and Cantonment areas will not benefit from this move," Sharma said.On Tuesday, the Congress claimed that the AAP's announcement regarding the supply of free potable water was essentially achieved through "mischievous manipulation of statistics".Former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said the AAP's policy on water was 'hardly different' from that followed by the Congress during its tenure.Speaking to Newsline, Dikshit said, "The AAP's policy on water is hardly very different from the existing one. It's important to study what exactly it is that they have changed."On being asked whether or not the new policy would strain the DJB, she said this was now the responsibility of Kejriwal and was something he'd have to figure it out."The decision taken by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would only benefit 15%-20% water consumers and those who really need free drinking water, would not get the promised 700 litres of water," Sharma said.... contd.
There was heavy security in the capital on New Year's Eve. Several points in the city were barricaded and armed policemen were seen manning the barricades, checking each and every vehicle passing on the road. Earlier in the day, the Police Commissioner had asked senior officers to patrol their respective districts and ranges. All personnel at the police stations were ordered to report for duty and conduct stringent checks in their areas. At least 1,600 police personnel were posted in Connaught Place on Tuesday evening. There were a total of 51 police pickets in and around the Connaught Place area. Police sources said there were around 15 check posts in the New Delhi district, with most in front of hotels and bars. Heavy security was also deployed at India Gate and in some parts of South Delhi. Police sources said senior officers of the rank of Deputy Commissioners of Police and Joint Commissioners of Police were ordered to patrol various roads till 2.30 am. Entry to Connaught Place had been banned for all after 10 pm, except those who have their offices and hotel bookings.  Door-frame metal detectors were also installed at the entrances to Connaught Place.The traffic police were also posted in full strength, conducting stringent checks for drink driving. The traffic police chief, Special Commissioner Taj Hasan, said a meeting had been held with bar owners urging them to raise awareness about drink driving. Hasan said traffic police would be coordinating with local police in various areas to stop drink driving. Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deepak Mishra said, "We appeal to the people to celebrate the New Year peacefully. We have provided enough security on the streets of the city tonight. Safety of women is our prime concern. Our officials will be on the roads to help anyone in need. I request people to immediately call the police control room, if they spot any suspicious activity."
The Home Ministry has okayed a request for 200 more vans and 3,000 personnel for the police control room unit of the Delhi Police.The Delhi Police had sought more vans and personnel for its PCR unit. It had told the ministry that its PCR unit, the first responder to crimes in the capital, was understaffed. The PCR unit, for several months now, had been requesting the ministry to increase its strength to improve efficiency.A police officer said the department needs more vans and personnel so that the jurisdiction limit of each PCR van can be reduced, bringing down the response time of the police and increasing their efficiency. The additional personnel and vans will be added to the PCR fleet by the end of this financial year."The PCR unit is understaffed and needs 5,400 additional personnel. We need at least nine personnel per PCR van to work in three shifts. Since we are understaffed and have a fleet size that is inadequate, the jurisdiction limit of each PCR van is quite large now, which means PCR personnel take more time to reach a crime spot. Besides, more PCR vans will ensure more visibility of police on the streets and will act as a deterrent for criminals," a senior police officer said.At present, Delhi Police has 800 vans and 8,500 personnel in its PCR unit. Sources said at a meeting held recently in the Home Ministry, it was decided that a total of 3,000 additional personnel will be sanctioned and 200 more vans will be added to the existing fleet, bringing the total number of vans in the unit to 1,000.An additional 2,400 personnel will be added to the police control room unit by 2015.
It was an unusually quiet protest. Around 500 people gathered at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday evening, held a candle light vigil, while communicating to each other their thoughts on the disability rights Bill. There were people in wheelchairs, people who cannot hear and those who cannot speak. But that did not lead to an unenthusiastic protest. Excited hand gestures and facial expressions could be seen in every direction."We are protesting against the fact that even after the approval by the Cabinet of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill on December 12, the Bill wasn't even tabled in Parliament before the Houses got adjourned," Javed Abidi, the convenor of the Disabled Rights Group, an advocacy group for the rights of physically challenged people, said. "Four years went into drafting that Bill. We are scared that the government does not give this Bill any priority and given upcoming general elections, Parliament may not be re-convened early next year for any legislative business. If this happens, then all our effort since the past four years will go down the drain."Abidi, in a wheelchair, could be seen going around the gathering accepting wishes for the new year as well as instructing a few people about the steps to be taken next. Communicating to a hearing- and speech-impaired person, he wrote on a piece of paper: "Arun Jaitley, 11.30 am." Then he outlined a house with his hands indicating that the meeting was to take place in Jaitley's house on Wednesday. He then told him that he should remember to take an interpreter along. "We met the Vice President yesterday. He has promised us unequivocal support. So has Prakash Karat, who we have met before," he said.Sanjeev Malhotra, a 48-year-old government official also in a wheelchair, was watching from a distance. "I have come here to express my support to the cause, but this is not enough," he says. "They have to be more vocal about it. They have to take this beyond a mere emotional display at Jantar Mantar." ... contd.

Centre StageThe curtains will rise on the 16th Bharat Rang Mahotsav on January 4 with a play that has all the trappings of a classic. Directed by Kerala-based KN Panikkar, Chhaya Shakuntalam will be enacted by the National School of Drama Repertory Company, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary. The play is a retelling of Kalidasa's Abhijnana Shakuntalam. Shakuntala represents the green world of nature and Dushyant, a hunter who shoots down a deer. The play highlights the hunt for a prey as well as the quest of a desirous mind.On a Classical NoteUstad Shahid Parvez Khan, one of the most skilled sitar players, takes the stage to commemorate the 75th year of Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan of the famous Rampur Sahaswan gharana.

His concerts might have music connoisseurs sit in judgement; comparisons will be inevitable. Another concert to look forward to will be by Pakistan-based dhrupad singer Aliya Rasheed. A blind musician and a student of famous dhrupadiyas, the Gundecha Brothers, Rasheed is also the only female Pakistani dhrupad singer. Dhrupad, a genre that emerged from the Vedas has many references to Indian mythology and religion, for which Rasheed has earned quite a bit of flak in Pakistan. We look forward to her favourite Ganesh vandana at India Habitat Centre this January.... contd.

Around 4,000 doctors across Maharashtra will go on an indefinite strike from Thursday in protest against the alleged assault on a resident doctor in Solapur's Civil hospital by three policemen on Tuesday morning. The strike will directly affect work in all public hospitals of the state.The strike was called after Dr Prashant Patil was thrashed by three local police personnel following an altercation. The policemen apparently asked Dr Patil to immediately attend to a pregnant lady who they had brought in, even as he was helping another patient with a CT scan test.Medical Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president Dr Santosh Wakchaure said since Patil was from a surgical ward, he requested them to visit the gynecology ward for delivery. "When he told them that he does not have the expertise to help in delivery and that he was already busy with another patient, they started beating him up," Wakchaure alleged."We want the policemen to be suspended since this is a breach of Medical Personnel and Medical Caregivers Protection Act, 2008. One cannot just assault a doctor and go scott free," added Wakchaure. While an FIR has been filed, MARD said the protest will not be called off until action is taken against the three policemen.Solapur's Civil hospital's dean Dr Ashok Shinde said: "While the protest will hamper our work, we cannot do anything about it." He said the doctors wanted to know why one of them was assaulted for no fault of his.The protest will impact hospitals across the state as MARD has around 4,000 doctors attached to it, half of them in Mumbai alone. The state has around 10,000 government doctors in all. Sion hospital dean Dr Avinash Supe admitted that routine work and the out patient department will be affected if the strike continues for long. "For emergency cases, our senior doctors and professors will be available. But they can only tackle a handful of cases. Patients coming to the OPD or for general health issues might face a problem," Supe said.
To add to the tragedy over the death of a minor gangrape victim  in Kolkata on New Year's Eve, political parties having been fighting among themselves to claim the body for political advantage. Despite the father's repeated appeals to all political parties to stay away from them, as the family had no political affiliations, leaders of some parties tried to get hold of the body to hold protests in the city. Ignoring resistance from the family, the Kolkata Police shifted the body to the Nimtala crematorium. However, early on Wednesday morning, CITU workers snatched the body from the police and took it to their office. Even as some rights activists expressed outrage over the incident, leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress dismissed the episode as a "conspiracy" against the government.While it was widely believed that the victim tried to set herself ablaze, it has come to light now that the 16-year-old girl in her final statement told the police that she was set on fire by her assailants. The police have now lodged a complaint of murder and gangrape against the arrested suspects in the case. The family members of the victim originally hail from Samastipur in Bihar and had settled in Madhyamgram of North 24 Paragana to get their children educated. It is learnt that the second gang rape of the girl happened after she dared to lodge a police complaint about the first attack on her. Following constant threats from the accused, the family left Madhyamgram and settled at Dum Dum in the outskirts of Kolkata a couple of months ago.

Among those arrested from Sendhwa in MP was Abu Fazal alias Doctor who had escaped from Khandwa jail in the intervening night between September 30 and October 1 last year. Five other SIMI activists had also fled with Fazal but the police are yet to reach them.ATS chief Sanjeev Shami told reporters on Wednesday that 12 improvised explosive devices, 900 gelatine rods and 600 detonators were seized from the four SIMI activists. The police refused to share what the preliminary interrogation of the activists revealed and what they planned to do with such vast quantity of explosives.The police said they could reach the four activists from information provided by Fazal, a hardcore activist allegedly involved in several acts of terror in the country. Fazal was first arrested in June 2011 along with many other SIMI activists.The ATS had last week also arrested two persons Sadia and Umer Hafiz from Solapur after a joint operation carried out with the help of Maharashtra police. The MP police had seized three improvised explosives, 70 gelatin rods and 100 detonators during that operation.The MP police had claimed the duo was associated with Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The police reached the duo after being tipped by Khalid Ahmed, one of the three arrested from Barwani.
Rejecting the contention of private power distributors, the Delhi government on Wednesday ordered a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit of their finances, fulfilling yet another election promise of the Aam Aadmi Party."We have ordered an audit of the private power distribution companies. The CAG has said it will do the audit," Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet which took the decision on the audit.He said the Lt Governor's order on the audit of the companies will go to the CAG on Thursday. "From tomorrow, the audit will begin," he said.The Delhi Government had given time to the three companies -- BSES Yamuna Power Ltd, BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd -- till this morning to give their views on why there should not be a CAG audit of their companies.Asked what the companies have told the government, Kejriwal said they had given numerous reasons but not one reason why the audit should not be done."Nobody has given any reason why there should not be an audit," he said adding the auditing will cover from the days the power distribution was privatised.He also rejected the view that the matter was subjudiced and the decision cannot be taken. "The matter has been in the High Court and proceedings are on. No stay has been granted. Even now the proceedings can go on."On complaints about the defective quality of power meters, the Chief Minister said the government would approach IIT Delhi and Delhi College of Engineering for suggestion to improve the quality of meters.
The New Year began with fresh trouble within the ruling Congress in Andhra Pradesh following change in portfolio of a minister from Telangana, triggering strong protests from his cabinet colleagues from the region.While ministers of AP Cabinet hailing from Telangana cried foul over late last night's decision of Chief Minister N  Kiran Kumar Reddy, he shot back asserting that allocation of portfolios to ministers was his sole prerogative.At a time when the party was vertically split along Telangana and Seemaandhra lines, Civil Supplies Minister D Sridhar Babu was divested of the additional portfolio of Legislative Affairs and, in lieu, given charge of the Commercial Taxes Department.The Legislative Affairs charge was given to S Sailajanath, as an addition to the School Education portfolio he has been holding. Sridhar Babu belongs to Telangana and Sailajanath to Seemaandhra.Ironically, Sridhar Babu was one of the most trusted lieutenants of the Chief Minister ever since they worked together as government whip and chief whip respectively between 2004 and 2009 when Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was the CM."Change in portfolio of the minister was purely for administrative convenience and that's my prerogative. Revenue from commercial taxes saw a sharp decline and we wanted to boost it up. So, the minister was given charge of the crucial department," the Chief Minister told reporters in an informal chat at his camp office.  Commercial taxes contributed 26 per cent to the state revenues two years ago but fell to 15 per cent last year and further to 9.5 per cent this year, he pointed out.Interestingly, the CM himself had been holding charge of the Commercial Taxes Department for the past three years. Sridhar Babu, on the other hand, was said to have offered to quit the Cabinet in protest against the "insult to people of Telangana" but his colleagues dissuaded him from taking any hasty step. ... contd.

Unimpressed by the government's decision to cancel the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal over allegations that kickbacks were paid, the BJP Wednesday suggested the move was an attempt to shield people close to the establishment who it said had received bribes.It demanded the government come clean on the identities of 'AP' and 'FAM' who are accused of being bribed by a key middleman in the deal."This is a decision in desperation because serious suspicion was being raised about the involvement of people in the ruling establishment. We want to know what does 'AP' and the family, who are tipped to have got the money, mean," BJP deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said. "This question has not been answered yet. It is a rearguard action."�BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said the UPA government could not hope to shield itself by cancelling the deal."This government cannot shield itself by cancelling the deal because we know that this is a government by scam, for scam and of scam. We want to know who is AP and who is the family who have received large amounts," Javadekar said.�As reported by The Indian Express last month, Italian prosecutors produced in court a "budget" drawn up by two middlemen which purportedly lists initials of Indian politicians and designations of bureaucrats and IAF officers who allegedly had to be "handled" to fix the deal.The document is a note Swiss businessman Guido Haschke claimed he wrote during a meeting with British middleman Christian Michel in 2008.�Under the heading "POL" - Haschke has explained in court this referred to Indian politicians - there is a reference to "AP" against which "3 million euro" has been listed.�The other is "FAM" - explained by Italian investigators in other documents as "Family" - against which "15/16 million euro" has been listed. It is not clear if Haschke has explained in court what "AP" and "FAM" refer to.�... contd.

After the surprising news of Pakistani actress Veena Malik tying the knot to a Dubai-based businessman spread like wild fire, now, Veena Malik's alleged boyfriend has filed a police complaint against her.Prashant Pratap Singh, an employee from Veena's team claimed that she was his live-in partner and the two were planning to take their relationship to the next level of marriage. However, her wedding with Dubai based Asad Khan came as a shock to Prashant who has been staying with the bold actress in Mumbai and has also been bearing her expenses in the country. While Prashant tried to confront her, he claims that she not only threatened him but also his mother if they reveal about her past with him in public. Hence, Prashant filed a complaint against actress turned singer Veena Malik and pressed charges of criminal intimidation.Veena however denies these statements and stated that Prashant was a mere employee whom she paid Rs. 10,000 per month as a salary. Also, she claimed that she isn't sure of his motives behind filing this complaint.The police have filed an NC against Veena under IPC section 507.
Actor Christian Bale is reportedly being asked by his wife Sibi Blazic to quit racing motorbikes for films as she is scared by the sudden demise of 'Fast and Furious' star Paul Walker.The 'American Hustle' actor, who is a huge enthusiast of two-wheelers, had controlled his stunts after the birth of their daughter Emmaline, reported Contactmusic."Sibi has always had a problem with Christian's love of fast bikes. She stopped him from riding them on the streets shortly after the birth of (their daughter) Emmaline, eight years ago," a source said."Since then, Christian has limited his riding to the race track under very controlled conditions," the source added.Walker's death in a fiery single-car accident earlier this year has hit Bale's wife."Sibi doesn't want Christian racing at all, and that's going to be a real struggle for him... As tough as it is for him, Christian is going to quit racing for her. She rules the household and his attitude is, she's the boss," the source added. 
Inspired from the Tamil blockbuster Mudhalvan, 'Nayak' remains as one of the milestones of Anil Kapoor's career. Post the success of '24', the actor who is busy with a lot of films, has plans to make a sequel to his popular film.Anil revealed that he will co-produce and act in the sequel which will have a different storyline with cues taken from real-life incidents. The second installment will also have a plot revolving around politics where the lead will play a crusader of sorts.

Agent of Change: The City VoterA Mumbaikar has never really been a voting enthusiast. More so, if he has a south Mumbai address. But this year, the birth of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led to a super turnout in the country's political capital. So, will India's financial capital stage a turnaround and drive voters to the polling booths? Or will tedium take over the better of their spirits, like always. For instance, despite a massive public outcry after the 26/11 terror attacks in 2008, the voter turnout in Mumbai remained abysmal at less than 44 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections that followed four months later.With the city accounting for six Lok Sabha seats and 36 of the total 288 Assembly seats in the state, Mumbaikars are naturally sought after voters. And though the city has been notorious for poor voter turnouts, there is optimism among activists and psephologists this time around.Price rise that directly affects the middle-class and the corruption expos�s have prodded voters across the country, especially in urban areas, to come out and vote. "Pockets such as Greater Kailash in New Delhi that always had low turnout suddenly saw 70 per cent people casting their votes - an AAP affect. We can hope something similar in south Mumbai where voters have always shunned elections," says Ajit Ranade, economist with AV Birla group.Ranade's optimism is borne out by official data. In a drive undertaken by the collector over the last 18 months, 6.28 lakh new voters have been registered in suburbs, taking the total number of registered voters to over 73 lakh. Similarly, 1.08 lakh new voters were added to the 26 lakh voters in the island city in the past one year. "The quantum of voter registrations, especially first-time voters, is much higher this time around," says C V Oak, island city collector. Moreover, the deletion of 12 lakh 'extra' names from electoral rolls will also naturally bump up the voter-turnout percentage. ... contd.
Every year on June 24, in the bustling East Indian village of Irla in Vile Parle (west), an unusual tradition is followed as a commemoration to St John the Baptist.St John, or as the locals call him, Sao Jao, is recognised in the Bible as a preacher with a unique practice of baptism for forgiveness of sins. According to the Christian faith, St John is also the man who baptised Christ in the rivers of Jordan. The East Indians of century-old Vile Parle gaothan, interpret this action a little further."The feast is a much-awaited time of the year. In addition to the religious ceremonies and the feast held in honour of Sao Jao, we have a tradition of jumping in the village's wells. This practice is especially reserved for the newly-weds. After the big feast in their homes, they must dance in a parade around the neighbourhood to the live music of the East Indian bands," said Cheryl D'Souza, a resident of Irla.As the young couples move around the neighbourhood, they are drenched in a shower of water by residents of buildings and houses on the route, who use buckets and pipes to hose them down. The parades end at the four village wells, and as a grand finale, the couples are thrown into the water bodies deliberately. "Even if the person does not know how to swim, they have to jump in the well. A big tyre is tied as a floatation device or a swimming float is brought along, but all must jump. Along with the couples, other members of the community, and whoever wishes to, is welcome to jump in the well. If it is a rainy day, it is double the fun as the whole affair turns into a big rain dance party," said D'Souza.... contd.

The number of mobile Internet users in India seems all set for explosive growth with a report by Internet & Mobile Association Of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International predicting that there will be 155 million people accessing the web through their phones by the end of March 2014. With a quarter-over-quarter growth of 20 per cent, this number is expected to cross 185 million by June 2014, says the 'Mobile Internet In India 2013' report released Wednesday. According to the report, in October 2013, India had 110 million mobile internet users, with just 25 million in rural India. Urban India's dominance of this segment is expected to continue for at least a couple of quarters. Indicating that many Indian's were accessing the internet for the first time on mobile devices, the report says across both urban and rural India over half the Internet users where on the mobile.One of the reasons for this increase in mobile Internet penetration is the fact that the average cost per user had fallen to Rs 387 from Rs 460 in 2012, even though the actual per cent of data costs in mobile bills has gone up slightly from 43 to 45 per cent over the past year. The other reason is the falling costs of Internet enabled smart devices. In fact, a I-Cube Mobile Internet survey conducted in 35 cities in 2013 puts the median cost of web-enabled mobile phone at Rs 7,000 with 52 per cent of Mobile Internet users owning devices priced between Rs 6,501 and Rs 14,000.
In the end the 4 did push out the incumbent 3, after all if had been there for 365 days. As predicted by us, the Google doodle for December 31 did transform to reveal 2014. The animated number are now on celebrating the New Year, complete with blaring speakers and a disco ball. Google's New Year's Eve doodle will transform. You can bet on itEven last year, Google had marked the last day of 2012 with a doodle that finally morphed into another the next day. So while December 31, 2012 was marked by a doodle of people partying hard, January 1, 2013 showed the same scene almost empty with just the cleaners around. This has been a recurring theme with Google's doodles every New Year's Eve since 2011. It is always the same doodle that transforms into another to mark the transition of the year. Before that, there was no tradition of having a special doodle on December 31, though the new year was always marked with one. 
'Anna Karenina' star Keira Knightley has revealed that she once secretly joined Twitter using a pseudonym only to delete the account 12 hours later.The 28-year-old actress says Twitter made her feel a little bit like being in a school playground and not being popular and standing on the sidelines, reported Ace Showbiz. "It made me feel a little bit like being in a school playground and not being popular and standing on the sidelines kind of going, 'Argh'," Knightley said."No, I think that's fine. I like being private. I haven't asked a lot of the actresses who I really admire, 'How do you do it?' because I don't want to know. Maybe I'm childish in that way; I just don't want to know about your life," she added. 
Snapchat, Vine, and Candy Crush Saga earned coveted spots on smartphones this year, making them among the most downloaded apps of the year.There are more than a million apps on Apple Inc's App Store and Google Inc's Play store, the two dominant marketplaces for apps, which see billions of downloads each year.This year, the most downloaded apps were new takes on communication, gaming, and entertainment, according to mobile app experts."2013 was a really interesting year in terms of maturation, milestones and new trends," said Craig Palli, chief strategy officer at Fiksu, a mobile marketing company based in Boston."The most downloaded apps were in familiar categories, but offered new twists," he added.While old favorites such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter � available for iPhone, Android and other devices - continued to be popular ways of communicating with friends, Snapchat eclipsed them in downloads in 2013, becoming the sixth most downloaded free app of the year on the App Store, according to Apple."Snapchat went from being a niche app to achieving much more critical mass, so much so that Facebook was reportedly willing to spend billions of dollars to acquire the company," said Palli.With Snapchat, users can send photos and videos that disappear shortly after they are viewed.Launched in 2011, the app's user base continued to grow rapidly in 2013, with over 13 million people using the app in October, according to the lastest available estimates from global information and measurement company Nielsen. In December alone, over 400 million pieces of content were shared through the app, according to Snapchat, based in Venice, CA.Vine, a video sharing app released earlier this year by microblogging company Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), was the fourth most downloaded free app in 2013. The app, for iPhone, Android and other devices, allows users to share videos under six seconds in length. Nielsen estimates over 6 million people in the US were using the app in October of this year.... contd.
A group of volunteers from different parts of Assam have made an innovation of sorts by designing an Assamese word processor similar to the Microsoft Word with a spell checker and word suggestions to boot. Named Jahnabi, the word processor has came as a boon for those who need help in writing the language and can be easily used by those with a rudimentary knowledge of Assamese."The website www.jahnabi.org has received more than 60,000 hits and the free-of-cost software downloaded by more than 1,000 people since it was launched online on November 25 last," says Mridul Kumar Sharmah, one of the members of the team.The Unicode compliant software with a size of 7 mega bytes has at present nearly 2.5 lakh Assamese words and 108 readymade Assamese phrases in its dictionary and counting."The programming of the processor is based on dotnet platform and C# language containing around 15,000 lines of code," Utpal Phukon, the only programmer in the Jahnabi team, said.It took almost 25 days to complete the beta version of the software and the final software was designed in four months, he said.The software contains automatic suggestions for words. Just type the alphabet K and all the words beginning with Ka would appear like Kalam and Kamal. There are also 600 Assamese idioms. The user has the option to create a shortcut for frequently used idioms. There is also a facility to add words to the user's dictionary."If one types the alphabets K and M, words like Kamal and Kamtapur would be listed. All one has to do is click on the word which is required from the list. This makes it easy for people who do not have an in-depth knowledge of the language," Sharmah said. "The main aim to develop the processor is to popularise the Assamese language through Internet and social networking sites as most of the people in the state have rudimentary knowledge of the language due to reasons best known to them," Sharmah said.... contd.
According to a report titled Market Vision 2014 for Telecommunications in India by Cyber Media Research, Indian mobile brands are going to make a mark in the local smartphones market by acquiring nearly 47% share of the total sales.  With such tremendous growth and success witnessed by these brands in the local market, 2014 will be the time to look at newer geographies including MENA, Latin America and the SAARC region for the home grown vendors.  CMR expects 3-4 such brands looking for new geographic markets. While Chinese ODM's (Original design manufacturers have started taking a direct OEM route towards India Smartphone market, CMR expects around 10 Chinese ODMs entering into Indian mobile market in the year. ahead. The reports also finds that LTE enabled smartphone releases are likely to be one of key priority areas of the vendors.
A new democratic experimentalism is in the air.India's great churning will continue in the coming year. There is new momentum towards change. The momentum will be most manifest in glimpses of a new institutional order that is coming into being. India's progressive moment is now beginning to find its feet, with a clamour for a governance architecture that is more horizontal, transparent, decentralised, based on public reason and allows for new political formations to emerge. This process will continue. The flotsam of the old order will continue to be visible, and will often disguise the new undercurrents forming. More poison may come out of the system as partisan competition intensifies. But amid all the high-decibel exchanges, a quiet revolution will continue. But the revolution will be most palpable in a subtle reorientation of attitudes. The most besetting sin of Indian democracy over the last couple of years has been its corrosive cynicism. It was a cynical democracy with much to be cynical about. But the cynicism had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Few believed anything could change, so little changed. There were no texts, there were only subtexts. Virtue was nothing but deception. We converted it into such an art form that there was cynicism about everything that pretended to be anything other than cynicism. The cynicism was compounded by what Amartya Sen has made India's badge of self-identification: the argumentative Indian. We thought arguing was generally a good thing, since it denoted a kind of freedom and engagement with learning. But we forgot the other side. An argumentative person is someone who goes on arguing, well after the matter has been settled. Much of our public argument had this character. It was not argument in the interest of learning; it was argument in the interest of going on and on. Few who came to the argument were open to being persuaded, few were open to any possibilities other than what they had already committed to.... contd.
Syed Ata HusnainOn India-Pakistan, the good news is that the armies are talking.It is good to see the trust reposed in the director-general of military operations (DGMO) to stabilise, if not resolve, a tricky military-to-military relationship, which more often than not transforms into a tricky nation-to-nation relationship. But what do such meetings really achieve, and how should they be handled? This time around, it's been all about the Line of Control (LoC) and the frequent flare-ups which threaten to trigger greater tension with Pakistan.The DGMO meeting is not a flag meeting. Flag meetings are at the level of local commanders or staff. They take place on either side of the LoC or border, as the case may be. They are not part of the political dialogue but are just border conferences to temporarily dilute a military standoff in a situation where political parleys are not possible. Unlike a political dialogue, it does not take much effort to organise a flag meeting. Sometimes, they can be held for a specific purpose, not linked to the LoC or to border tension. However, the usual flag meetings at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and LoC are held to de-escalate a crisis situation. A flag meeting between general officers is rare � it remains pegged at the level of colonel or brigadier to keep the agenda local. It does not resolve an issue and neither should it be expected to � unless it is to hand over or take back someone who has unwittingly crossed the LoC. This is because the agenda is usually contentious and the participants are not empowered to dilute the established positions. There have been times when firing has recommenced in the vicinity of a flag meeting, even as the local commanders returned to their respective sides after the meeting. Lasting solutions to even local problems are almost impossible.... contd.
Falling in love can trigger a warm, pleasurable feeling all over the body while being anxious may be felt as pain in the chest, according to a new Finnish study which found common emotions trigger strong bodily sensations.Researchers from Aalto University in Finland studied how emotions are experienced in the body.They found that the most common emotions trigger strong bodily sensations, and the bodily maps of these sensations were topographically different for different emotions.However, the sensation patterns were consistent across different West European and East Asian cultures, highlighting that emotions and their corresponding bodily sensation patterns have a biological basis."Emotions adjust not only our mental, but also our bodily states. This way they prepare us to react swiftly to the dangers, but also to the opportunities such as pleasurable social interactions present in the environment," said assistant professor Lauri Nummenmaa from Aalto University."Awareness of the corresponding bodily changes may subsequently trigger the conscious emotional sensations, such as the feeling of happiness," Nummenmaa said."The findings have major implications for our understanding of the functions of emotions and their bodily basis. On the other hand, the results help us to understand different emotional disorders and provide novel tools for their diagnosis," Nummenmaa said.The research was carried out on over 700 individuals from Finland, Sweden and Taiwan. The researchers induced different emotional states in their Finnish and Taiwanese participants.Subsequently the participants were shown with pictures of human bodies on a computer, and asked to colour the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing."Most basic emotions were associated with sensations of elevated activity in the upper chest area, likely corresponding to changes in breathing and heart rate," the researchers said in Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences.Sensations in the head area were shared across all emotions, reflecting probably both physiological changes in the facial area (ie, facial musculature activation, skin temperature, lacrimation) as well as the felt changes in the contents of mind triggered by the emotional events, they said.... contd.
Lack of a good night's sleep may damage your brain in a similar way to being hit on the head, a new study has warned.The study from Uppsala University, Sweden, shows that one night of sleep deprivation increases morning blood concentrations of molecules NSE and S-100B in healthy young men.These molecules are typically found in the brain. Thus, their rise in blood after sleep loss may indicate that a lack of sleep may result in loss of brain tissue, researchers said.Fifteen normal-weight men participated in the study. In one condition they were sleep-deprived for one night, while in the other condition they slept for approximately 8 hours."We observed that a night of total sleep loss was followed by increased blood concentrations of NSE and S-100B. These brain molecules typically rise in blood under conditions of brain damage," said sleep researcher Christian Benedict at the Department of Neuroscience, Uppsala University, who led the study."Thus, our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neuro degenerative processes," said Benedict. "In conclusion, the findings of our trial indicate that a good night's sleep may be critical for maintaining brain health," said Benedict. The findings are published in the journal SLEEP. 
New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson scored the quickest century ever in international cricket on Wednesday, taking just 36 balls against West Indies to break the record long held by Pakistan's Shahid Afridi.Afridi scored a 37-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in 1996 and had remained the fastest across all formats of the international game since.Anderson, 23, brought up the mark with his 12th six of the innings after the third one-day international in Queenstown was reduced to a 21-over match due to rain.Fastest ODI 100sBalls36 C Anderson 201437 S Afridi 199644 M Boucher 200645 B Lara 199945 S Afridi 200546 J Ryder 2014#NZvWINew Zealand captain Brendon McCullum (33 off 11 balls) started the onslaught before Jesse Ryder (104), who completed his hundred in 46 balls, and Anderson added 191 runs for the fourth wicket."It's one of those things you don't plan on doing when you go out there but obviously with it (being) a reduced game it makes it easier to go harder at it earlier and Brendon showed his intent early on and Jesse played an unbelievable innings as well," Anderson said in a televised interview."I think we went pretty good together. I was hitting boundaries and he was hitting boundaries. It was just one of those things that comes off."I think me and Jesse were thinking every ball was going to get us out or go for six so it was nice to have that feeling out there and get them out of the middle."Anderson remained unbeaten on 131 off 47 balls with 14 sixes and half a dozen fours to take New Zealand to a mammoth 283 for four wickets in their innings.Asked if he was aware of the record, the left-hander said: "No. I didn't have a clue actually. It's not like I look it up and take it down but I guess it's nice to have that."
Irfan Pathan didn't get a game as India won the Champions Trophy in England earlier this year. Before the tournament, the pacer all-rounder was seen as someone who would give the perfect balance to the side playing away from the sub-continent. The world was in for a surprise, as the pitches in England turned out to be dry and abrasive. Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja couldn't believe their luck. The two spinners snapped 20 wickets between them.Seven months on, the focus has now shifted to the next big ICC event�the ODI World Cup in Australia-New Zealand early next year. Once again the guessing game has started. There is a general consensus in the cricketing circles that the pitches at Perth, Sydney, Dunedin or  Napier will provide lateral movement and the conditions will make the ball swing in the air. And that's the reason, 29-year-old Stuart Binny finds himself in the  ODI squad for the New Zealand tour. The Karnataka all-rounder has piled runs, taken wickets and, most importantly, shed weight. It remains to be seen if Binny will be pacer-all rounder who will exploit the conditions and come handy with both bat and ball during the World Cup next year. This plan will work provided the pitches Down Under behave the way they have historically done.  Along with a pacer-all rounder, the national selectors also seem to be looking for a tearaway speedsters, who can intimidate the rivals and give the team early breakthroughs. Till recently, Umesh Yadav fitted that bill perfectly. But after he picked up just one wicket in pace-friendly conditions in South Africa, there was a need for another audition. This resulted in Varun Aaron, the bowler capable of  bowling upwards of 145 kph, getting a call. Mohit Sharma making way for Ishwar Pandey, two pacers with similar skill sets, too is a case of weighing all options. Sharma and Yadav haven't been written off it is just that they have been asked to wait in the wings. This isn't a case of chopping and changing.

Putting to rest all speculations, it was today confirmed that star wrestlers Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt will compete in 74kg and 65kg categories respectively at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games to avoid face-off against each other.However, in the FILA competitions, including the world and the continental championships, they will compete in 70kg and 65kg categories.Two-time Olympic champion Sushil and London Games bronze medallist Yogeshwar, who were competing in the 66kg and 60kg freestyle respectively before FILA's announcement to rejig weight classes, have conveyed their decision to the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) after a series of discussions with the national coaches.As a result of their decision, Sushil and Yogeshwar will be seen competing in the 70kg and 65kg in the Colorado Springs tournament which will mark their return to the international arena since the 2012 London Games.This will be the first time post FILA's announcement that the two star grapplers will compete in the higher weight categories in the Dave Schultz Memorial International tournament from January 30 to February 1 in the USA."Sushil has decided to compete in 70kg for the FILA competitions while for Olympic qualifiers, Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, he has decided to move to 74kg to avoid any face-off against Yogeshwar. His childhood buddy Yogeshwar has also decided to move to 65kg from his traditional 60kg for Olympic events and FILA championships," chief national coach Vinod Kumar told PTI."The decision was arrived at after a series of talks with both the wrestlers. It was a tough decision but was taken keeping in mind the interest of our nation," he added.Sushil has struggled every time he had to reduce his weight to compete in 66kg. Yogeshwar has won his Olympic medal in the 60kg category in 2012 while Sushil competed in 66kg for his historic silver at the London Games.... contd.
Part-time offspinner Gurkeerat Singh and left-arm tweaker Rajwinder Singh finished with match-haul of eight wickets each as Punjab progressed into the knockout round by hammering Jharkhand by an innings and 173 runs in a Ranji Trophy Group A match here today.The result meant that Jharkhand will have to return to Group C after just one season.Off-spinner Gurkeerat took four for 59, while Rajwinder (3/38) and Rahul Sharma (3/15) picked three wickets apiece to skittle Jharkhand for 127 in their second innings at the Railway Stadium.Punjab bowlers took just 34.1 overs to bowl the hosts after they were asked to follow on Punjab skipper Mandeep Singh on day three here.Resuming the day on 210 for 9, Jharkhand could add only six runs to end their first innings 300 run behind Punjab's total of 516.Left-arm spinner Rajwinder added one more wicket to his overnight tally of four, bringing up his second five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.Asked to bat again, Jharkhand failed to negotiate the spin trio of Gurkeerat, Rajwinder and Rahul.Opener Rameez Nemat, who made 81 in the first innings, was the only batsman to resist once again as wickets kept tumbling at the other end.Nemat made 48 off 85 balls, including seven fours.Gurkeerat finished with match figures of eight for 99, while Rajwinder spent 106 runs to claim his eight scalps.Brief Scores:Punjab: 516Jharkhand: 216 & 127 allout 34.1 overs (Rameez Nemat 48, Kumar Deobrat 24; Gurkeerat Singh 4/59)Points: Punjab 7, Jharkhand 0.
Exploiting a spin-friendly track, Saurashish Lahiri wreaked havoc with a career-bestseven-wicket haul as Bengal sealed a spot in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals after a gap of six years, courtesy their narrow four-run win over formidable Tamil Nadu, here today.Needing 185 to win, Tamil Nadu, starting the day at 102 for one, were shot out for 180 as Bengal got six points from the match to take their tally to 24 from eight games.With Baroda on the verge of losing their match against Saurashtra, having conceded first innings lead, Bengal have ensured their passage to the last-eight stage.The victory comes as a major boost as it came on a pitch that was virtually kept under-prepared by the host association in order to ensure a smooth passage into knock-out.In the end, the move by Tamil Nadu coach WV Raman backfired badly as veteran Lahiri ripped through the middle-order today."We didn't have Manoj Tiwary (injured), Wriddhiman Saha and Mohammed Shami (on national duty) yet we have beaten two domestic heavyweights like UP and Tamil Nadu in two matches. I tell youngsters like Writtick (Chatterjee), Abhimanyu (Easwaran), Gitimoy (Basu) that more than runs, what we needed is big heart. They showed that they have a big heart," Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla told PTI from Chennai.Veteran off-spinner Lahiri with match-figures of 10/95 was the wrecker-in chief as he removed Dinesh Karthik (62), S Badrinath (21), Baba Indrajith (2) to set alarm bells ringing TN camp."It's not my best performance as I consider my five-for against Karnataka at Mysore on a flat deck some seven seasons back as my best effort. Here I was getting help from the track. But yes, this is the most special win of my 15-year domestic career," an ecstatic Lahiri said."Winning against a Tamil Nadu side with players like DK (Dinesh Karthik) and Badri is a big achievement. In fact the turning point was when I trapped Badri leg before. This is a season where I have re-discovered myself. It has been my best season for Bengal as an all-rounder," said Lahiri, who has 242 wickets and close to 2300 runs in first-class cricket.... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
At the end of the first day's play in Johannesburg, India had batted themselves into a decent position. The score read 255/5, their position looking even more robust because their captain was still at the crease. The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to not just set his record right in conditions outside the subcontinent. This was his chance to ride home the advantage for his team. It wasn't to be though as Dhoni perished, poking at a Vernon Philander delivery leaving him. One that could have been left alone. His dismissal for 19 also set in the rot as India lost their four wickets for not much.It wasn't the only time Dhoni set off a collapse or got out just when the situation called out for him to play a knock of significance. At Durban in the first innings, he and Ajinkya Rahane had helped India regain control with a 50-run stand for the fifth wicket. They had also taken India past the 300-run mark. Then Dhoni, batting on 24, went chasing after another length delivery outside his off-stump with his unique 'walking shot'. This time from a charged-up Steyn. Yet again the Indian skipper had fallen in the same fashion as has become customary of him in conditions where the ball moves around. The most disappointing of the lot was reserved for when India needed Dhoni the most. On the last day of the tour with the visitors hanging by the skin of their teeth to save the second Test and ensure that they walk away with a 0-0 verdict �which would have been akin to a win for India.The South African pacers had just finished their umpteenth spell on the day. Manning the attack now was Robin Peterson bowling from over the wicket into the rough, and hardly turning a ball. Just then Dhoni decided to use his forearms and muscle a length delivery outside his leg-stump over the mid-wicket fielder. Not only was the shot not on, it was also uncalled for considering the situation, especially with Rahane fighting tooth and nail at the other end to keep India's hopes alive. The ball only went as far as Alviro Petersen at mid-wicket. Dhoni could only throw his head sideways in despair. Soon after, the Indian tail lived up to their reputation and was blown away.... contd.
Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were dismissed cheaply in yet another pathetic batting show by Delhi, who are now staring at a big defeat against table toppers Karnataka in their final Ranji Trophy group league match, here today.Having conceded a first innings lead of 87 runs after Karnataka scored 289 in their first innings, Delhi were tottering at 132 for six at stumps on day three with a lead of 45 runs and four wickets in hand.Sehwag's (11) woeful first-class season might have ended today as he was trapped by a HS Sharath delivery that hit him below knee-roll having cut back a little. The umpire had little hesitation in giving him out.He had slashed one for four over slips in his 34-ball stay. Sehwag's Ranji season ended with 234 runs at a dismal average of less than 20 in 13 innings with a second innings 50 against Haryana.It will be highly unlikely that Sehwag will be picked in the North Zone team with the likes of Jiwanjot Singh and even his opening partner Gambhir (578) having scored lot more than him. It was a pity to see the 35-year old bespectacled opener struggle against unknown domestic bowlers even on benign pitches.Gambhir (26) again played those streaky shots through the slips with only confident boundary being clip through mid-wicket. He was dismissed before Sehwag when a ball kept low and he didn't commit fully on frontfoot as it thudded on the pads. Manan Sharma was also adjudged leg before by Ronit More (3/27) when a delivery hit him low as Delhi were 41 for three going into tea.Mithun Manhas (32) hit some flowing boundaries and just as he was getting into the groove, Shreyas Gopal's acrobatic catch off his own bowling saw him head back to pavilion.... contd.
The national selectors, on Tuesday, sprang a surprise by naming uncapped all-rounder Stuart Binny in the 16-member squad for the five-match ODI series in New Zealand that starts at Napier on January 19. Binny replaces Yuvraj Singh, the out-of-form all-rounder who was instrumental in India winning the 2011 World Cup. Yuvraj in his last 8 outings had scored 118 runs.Binny, whose father Roger was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team and is presently one of the selectors, had been a stand-out performer for Rajasthan Royals in last season's Indian Premier League. The medium pacer cum lower order batsman scored 293 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 147.23 and took six wickets with an economy rate of 6.75. Turning up for Karnataka, he has cored 281 runs from six Ranji Trophy games and took 11 wickets. This comes after a dream 2012-13 season when the 29-year-old finished with 612 runs at 47.07 and took 19 wickets at 41.89.With New Zealand expected to welcome India with green-tops, there was a school of thought that the selections should pick a technically proficient specialist who had the skills to negotiate the moving ball. After scoring 280 runs in two Tests in South Africa, Cheteshwar Pujara was the man. But by going for a a bits and pieces players, it is clear the Pujara doesn't seem to be figure in the scheme of things as the selectors look test players for the next year's World Cup that will be jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia.Pujara's List A average is 54.57 in 68 matches. He scored 199 runs in five List A games when he led India A to a tri-series in South Africa in August. Binny, on the other hand, has a List A average of 22.30 in 48 matches, though it has to be said he bats down the order. He also has 37 wickets at 36.64. In the three matches he played for India A in South Africa he scored six runs.... contd.
These have been a frustrating few weeks for Iqbal Abdulla. Despite some decent performances under his belt, like his four-wicket haul against Punjab, the selectors continued to give the left-arm spinner a cold shoulder repeatedly pointing out he wasn't up to the mark. However, with Mumbai playing at Gujarat and under pressure to win and qualify for the knockout stages, the selectors persisted with the tried-and-tested spinner. Perhaps, his past performance at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium here worked for him. His last five-wicket haul had come at this venue against the same opposition back in 2008.On Tuesday, Abdulla repaid the selectors' faith and justified his selection by picking up six wickets in the do-or-die game, keeping Mumbai's hopes of making the quarter-finals alive. Defending a meagre total of 154, Abdulla's fine spell marginally helped apply the skid-breaks on Gujarat and stop them from running away with the game as they notched up 253, a lead of 99. At stumps on Day Two, the visitors were 76 for four, still trailing by 23 runs, and staring at the steepest challenge of the season.But earlier on Tuesday, realising they needed quick wickets to stand any chance of making a comeback, Mumbai began on a bright note with medium-pacer Shardul Thakur removing Parthiv Patel soon after play began. Then, it was the time for Abdulla show.Ever since Mumbai found another left-arm spinner in Vishal Dabholkar last season, Abdulla's spot in the starting XI has been uncertain. Experts suggested he was more suited to the T20 format as he lacked variations and did not have a traditional spin bowlers' approach.However, he proved them wrong on Tuesday. He kept up the pressure from one end and looked the only bowler who could run through Gujarat's line-up. Abdulla added to his overnight tally by trapping opener Samit Gohel in front of stumps. Manprit Juneja, who himself is going through a rough patch, started well but was caught at slips by Wasim Jaffer off Abdulla. The left-armer didn't have much trouble finishing off Gujarat's tail-enders Chirag Gandhi, Rakesh Dhruv and Ishwar Choudhary.... contd.
It is inevitable that the latest call-up to the Indian ODI squad, Stuart Binny would face additional scrutiny for being the son of selector Roger Binny. However, at least on the day he made the cut for the New Zealand tour, Binny Junior, gave enough and more testament to his ability with a game-changing knock albeit in a different format. Coming into bat with his side both stuck in first gear on a tricky Feroze Shah Kotla pitch and precariously placed at 73/4 after 35 overs, Binny resurrected the innings, hitting six sixes and seven boundaries in a 94-ball 88. Binny would be dismissed with Karnataka two runs short of Delhi's first innings total 202, but his side eventually took the first innings lead and at stumps were comfortably placed at  226/5.While Binny's knock essentially pulled the rug from under Delhi's feet. The hosts needed to win the game to have any chance of progressing to the knock outs, were hamstrung from the start of the day.  Poor visibility delayed the start for close to two hours and it stayed bad enough for umpires to force spinner Varun Sood and military medium Rajat Bhatia to bowl first, instead of Ashish Nehra and Sumit Narwal, who would have been best-placed to take advantage of overcast conditions. Bhatia though delivered for Delhi by bowling opener Mayank Agarwal in his first over. Eventually the light improved enough for Nehra to be introduced, and the pacer got R Samarth pulling to Sood at square leg. The pitch wasn't giving much turn but had no pace on it either, forcing batsmen to generate all the power. In addition the ball was keeping low and through two such deliveries, Varun Sood got last match's centurion Manish Pandey and Abrar Kazi out LBW. ... contd.
Retired Formula One champion Michael Schumacher's condition was stable overnight, but the brain injury he suffered during a skiing accident in the French Alps is still critical, his manager said Wednesday.Sabine Kehm told reporters that his condition has not changed since doctors said he showed small signs of improvement on Tuesday.Schumacher, who turns 45 on Friday, suffered critical head injuries when he fell and struck a rock while skiing. He has since undergone two brain operations and remains in a medically induced coma.''The good news for today is ... there's no significant changes,'' Kehm told reporters gathered outside the Grenoble hospital where he is being treated. ''However, it is still very early, and the situation overall is critical,'' she added.Doctors have refused to give a prognosis for Schumacher, saying they are focused on his immediate care. They are trying to reduce swelling in his brain by keeping him in a coma and lowering his body temperature to between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius (93.2 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit).Kehm said Schumacher was surrounded by his family and that there is always somebody with him.Schumacher is the most successful F1 driver in history, racking up a record 91 race wins. He retired from Formula One last year after garnering an unmatched seven world titles.His accident has drawn immense media attention, and Kehm confirmed Wednesday that earlier in the week security at the hospital stopped a journalist who was posing as a priest from approaching Schumacher.Schumi, as his fans affectionately call him, was famously aggressive on the track and no less intense off-hours. In retirement, he remained an avid skier, skydiver and horseback rider
A refreshed Roger Federer's clinical demolition of Jarkko Nieminen in his first match of 2014 suggested he could be a factor in the first major of the year.His debut appearance at the Brisbane International was rapturously greeted by tournament organisers and fans alike, but following his first year without a grand slam final appearance since 2002 it was not certain what stage of decline the Swiss ace was in.A 6-4 6-2 victory over his tough Finnish opponent hinted that he was ready to put on a competitive showing at Melbourne Park, now relieved of the back problems that dogged his 2013 campaign and contributed to his second and fourth-round exits at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open."I'm actually very clear in my mind," Federer told reporters. "Now it's just down to forehands and backhands and tactics and movement. That's kind of what you want it to be, because unfortunately it hasn't always been that way last year with my issues."The scoreline flattered Federer in some ways. Both men eked out four break points over the two sets and Nieminen fought on level terms at the baseline, hitting eye-catching forehand winners throughout.Federer's mastery of the pivotal points of the match showed the steel behind the game's most graceful player remained firmly in place and his preference for playing new tournaments is far from a retirement tour.For the crucial break of the first set he came from 0-40 down in the fifth game and then saved a break point on his own serve to build a two-game cushion.IMPERIOUS BESTIn the second stanza he immediately grabbed the initiative, breaking in the first game and with his serve at near its imperious best he never looked like letting the advantage slip."I expect myself to play a bit better in the next match, even though today was already very good for a first match in so many weeks," Federer said.... contd.
Every year, kids with big forehands and bigger ambitions, are subjected to a plethora of voices. Some voices are from within, others they can do without. The players who find success at an early age, few in number, are usually the ones that managed to weed out the wrong from the right.Yuki Bhambri was one of those few.In 2009, at just 17, he was the Australian Open boys' singles champion � a junior Grand Slam champion, just like Bernard Tomic had been in the previous year in Melbourne and Grigor Dimitrov had been in the previous year in New York.But while Tomic and Dimitrov soon found their calling as professionals with career high rankings in the low 20s, the voices had caught up with Bhambri.When Dimitrov and Tomic boasted of reaching the third round and quarterfinals of the French and Wimbledon respectively, Bhambri � who is yet to make the main draw of a Slam � played hard to make the second round of the Chennai Open. Before this week began, he had gotten there once in six attempts.The critics sharpened their vocal cords. Some blamed his game. Few wagged fingers at his fitness. Others faulted the facilities around him. By August this year, his ranking fell to a low of 593. All this, while his first round opponent at the 2014 Chennai Open, 22-year old Pablo Carreno Busta, moved astonishingly from a ranking of 700 something to 64th in the last 12 months.On Tuesday, Bhambri and Busta, boys who had crossed each other in opposite directions on the ladder, met. Dealing with those sniggering voices must not have been easy, but the Indian stepped it up on Chennai's show court to bridge the gap.A straight sets win (6-4, 6-3) in the first round of an ATP 250 event may not be much, but for Bhambri it was one step taken on a long and arduous journey ahead. At Nungambakkam on New Year's eve, Bhambri showed that he had the game and the tenacity to walk the remainder of that journey, with a strong and clinical performance.... contd.

It's a fair bet Michael Clarke won't be booed at the Sydney Cricket Ground this week when he sets out to become just the third Australia captain to achieve a 5-0 sweep over England in an Ashes series.Three years ago, Australian frustrations at their team's humiliation by a rampant England boiled over with some vociferous catcalling when Clarke, standing in for the injured Ricky Ponting, came out to bat in the fifth Test.Australia lost that series 3-1 with Clarke assuming the captaincy permanently not long afterwards and, although it has not always been a smooth path since, his team look more settled and confident than at any time in his reign.Victories by 381 runs, 218 runs, 150 runs and eight wickets  are Testimony to crushing Australian superiority in the first four Ashes Tests and Clarke's men will be going all out to drive home their advantage when the fifth gets underway on Friday."We want to win this match, we know we've got to do all the hard work and we're looking at this like a final," said pace bowler Mitchell Johnson, whose 31 wickets at an average 14.32 have been a key factor in Australia's"We know they are going to come out fighting hard. They're not going to want to lose 5-0."That fight back from a team that was number one in the world as recently as August 2012 has long been anticipated.The 3-0 home Ashes series triumph earlier this year and the two that preceded it in 2009 and 2010-11 are now distant memories and nothing in the performances in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Melbourne suggests England can turn things around in Sydney.Two key players are no longer with the touring party with batsman Jonathan Trott having returned home to deal with some psychological issues and spinner Graeme Swann retiring after the Ashes were relinquished in Perth.... contd.

Part-time offspinner Gurkeerat Singh and left-arm tweaker Rajwinder Singh finished with match-haul of eight wickets each as Punjab progressed into the knockout round by hammering Jharkhand by an innings and 173 runs in a Ranji Trophy Group A match here today.The result meant that Jharkhand will have to return to Group C after just one season.Off-spinner Gurkeerat took four for 59, while Rajwinder (3/38) and Rahul Sharma (3/15) picked three wickets apiece to skittle Jharkhand for 127 in their second innings at the Railway Stadium.Punjab bowlers took just 34.1 overs to bowl the hosts after they were asked to follow on Punjab skipper Mandeep Singh on day three here.Resuming the day on 210 for 9, Jharkhand could add only six runs to end their first innings 300 run behind Punjab's total of 516.Left-arm spinner Rajwinder added one more wicket to his overnight tally of four, bringing up his second five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.Asked to bat again, Jharkhand failed to negotiate the spin trio of Gurkeerat, Rajwinder and Rahul.Opener Rameez Nemat, who made 81 in the first innings, was the only batsman to resist once again as wickets kept tumbling at the other end.Nemat made 48 off 85 balls, including seven fours.Gurkeerat finished with match figures of eight for 99, while Rajwinder spent 106 runs to claim his eight scalps.Brief Scores:Punjab: 516Jharkhand: 216 & 127 allout 34.1 overs (Rameez Nemat 48, Kumar Deobrat 24; Gurkeerat Singh 4/59)Points: Punjab 7, Jharkhand 0.
Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir were dismissed cheaply in yet another pathetic batting show by Delhi, who are now staring at a big defeat against table toppers Karnataka in their final Ranji Trophy group league match, here today.Having conceded a first innings lead of 87 runs after Karnataka scored 289 in their first innings, Delhi were tottering at 132 for six at stumps on day three with a lead of 45 runs and four wickets in hand.Sehwag's (11) woeful first-class season might have ended today as he was trapped by a HS Sharath delivery that hit him below knee-roll having cut back a little. The umpire had little hesitation in giving him out.He had slashed one for four over slips in his 34-ball stay. Sehwag's Ranji season ended with 234 runs at a dismal average of less than 20 in 13 innings with a second innings 50 against Haryana.It will be highly unlikely that Sehwag will be picked in the North Zone team with the likes of Jiwanjot Singh and even his opening partner Gambhir (578) having scored lot more than him. It was a pity to see the 35-year old bespectacled opener struggle against unknown domestic bowlers even on benign pitches.Gambhir (26) again played those streaky shots through the slips with only confident boundary being clip through mid-wicket.

However, at least on the day he made the cut for the New Zealand tour, Binny Junior, gave enough and more testament to his ability with a game-changing knock albeit in a different format. Coming into bat with his side both stuck in first gear on a tricky Feroze Shah Kotla pitch and precariously placed at 73/4 after 35 overs, Binny resurrected the innings, hitting six sixes and seven boundaries in a 94-ball 88. Binny would be dismissed with Karnataka two runs short of Delhi's first innings total 202, but his side eventually took the first innings lead and at stumps were comfortably placed at  226/5.While Binny's knock essentially pulled the rug from under Delhi's feet. The hosts needed to win the game to have any chance of progressing to the knock outs, were hamstrung from the start of the day.  Poor visibility delayed the start for close to two hours and it stayed bad enough for umpires to force spinner Varun Sood and military medium Rajat Bhatia to bowl first, instead of Ashish Nehra and Sumit Narwal, who would have been best-placed to take advantage of overcast conditions. Bhatia though delivered for Delhi by bowling opener Mayank Agarwal in his first over. Eventually the light improved enough for Nehra to be introduced, and the pacer got R Samarth pulling to Sood at square leg. The pitch wasn't giving much turn but had no pace on it either, forcing batsmen to generate all the power. In addition the ball was keeping low and through two such deliveries, Varun Sood got last match's centurion Manish Pandey and Abrar Kazi out LBW. ... contd.
These have been a frustrating few weeks for Iqbal Abdulla. Despite some decent performances under his belt, like his four-wicket haul against Punjab, the selectors continued to give the left-arm spinner a cold shoulder repeatedly pointing out he wasn't up to the mark. However, with Mumbai playing at Gujarat and under pressure to win and qualify for the knockout stages, the selectors persisted with the tried-and-tested spinner. Perhaps, his past performance at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium here worked for him. His last five-wicket haul had come at this venue against the same opposition back in 2008.On Tuesday, Abdulla repaid the selectors' faith and justified his selection by picking up six wickets in the do-or-die game, keeping Mumbai's hopes of making the quarter-finals alive. Defending a meagre total of 154, Abdulla's fine spell marginally helped apply the skid-breaks on Gujarat and stop them from running away with the game as they notched up 253, a lead of 99. At stumps on Day Two, the visitors were 76 for four, still trailing by 23 runs, and staring at the steepest challenge of the season.But earlier on Tuesday, realising they needed quick wickets to stand any chance of making a comeback, Mumbai began on a bright note with medium-pacer Shardul Thakur removing Parthiv Patel soon after play began. Then, it was the time for Abdulla show.Ever since Mumbai found another left-arm spinner in Vishal Dabholkar last season, Abdulla's spot in the starting XI has been uncertain. Experts suggested he was more suited to the T20 format as he lacked variations and did not have a traditional spin bowlers' approach.However, he proved them wrong on Tuesday. He kept up the pressure from one end and looked the only bowler who could run through Gujarat's line-up. Abdulla added to his overnight tally by trapping opener Samit Gohel in front of stumps. Manprit Juneja, who himself is going through a rough patch, started well but was caught at slips by Wasim Jaffer off Abdulla. The left-armer didn't have much trouble finishing off Gujarat's tail-enders Chirag Gandhi, Rakesh Dhruv and Ishwar Choudhary.... contd.
The national selectors, on Tuesday, sprang a surprise by naming uncapped all-rounder Stuart Binny in the 16-member squad for the five-match ODI series in New Zealand that starts at Napier on January 19. Binny replaces Yuvraj Singh, the out-of-form all-rounder who was instrumental in India winning the 2011 World Cup. Yuvraj in his last 8 outings had scored 118 runs.Binny, whose father Roger was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team and is presently one of the selectors, had been a stand-out performer for Rajasthan Royals in last season's Indian Premier League. The medium pacer cum lower order batsman scored 293 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 147.23 and took six wickets with an economy rate of 6.75. Turning up for Karnataka, he has cored 281 runs from six Ranji Trophy games and took 11 wickets. This comes after a dream 2012-13 season when the 29-year-old finished with 612 runs at 47.07 and took 19 wickets at 41.89.With New Zealand expected to welcome India with green-tops, there was a school of thought that the selections should pick a technically proficient specialist who had the skills to negotiate the moving ball. After scoring 280 runs in two Tests in South Africa, Cheteshwar Pujara was the man. But by going for a a bits and pieces players, it is clear the Pujara doesn't seem to be figure in the scheme of things as the selectors look test players for the next year's World Cup that will be jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia.Pujara's List A average is 54.57 in 68 matches. He scored 199 runs in five List A games when he led India A to a tri-series in South Africa in August. Binny, on the other hand, has a List A average of 22.30 in 48 matches, though it has to be said he bats down the order. He also has 37 wickets at 36.64. In the three matches he played for India A in South Africa he scored six runs.... contd.
Every year, kids with big forehands and bigger ambitions, are subjected to a plethora of voices. Some voices are from within, others they can do without. The players who find success at an early age, few in number, are usually the ones that managed to weed out the wrong from the right.Yuki Bhambri was one of those few.In 2009, at just 17, he was the Australian Open boys' singles champion � a junior Grand Slam champion, just like Bernard Tomic had been in the previous year in Melbourne and Grigor Dimitrov had been in the previous year in New York.But while Tomic and Dimitrov soon found their calling as professionals with career high rankings in the low 20s, the voices had caught up with Bhambri.When Dimitrov and Tomic boasted of reaching the third round and quarterfinals of the French and Wimbledon respectively, Bhambri � who is yet to make the main draw of a Slam � played hard to make the second round of the Chennai Open. Before this week began, he had gotten there once in six attempts.The critics sharpened their vocal cords. Some blamed his game. Few wagged fingers at his fitness. Others faulted the facilities around him. By August this year, his ranking fell to a low of 593. All this, while his first round opponent at the 2014 Chennai Open, 22-year old Pablo Carreno Busta, moved astonishingly from a ranking of 700 something to 64th in the last 12 months.On Tuesday, Bhambri and Busta, boys who had crossed each other in opposite directions on the ladder, met. Dealing with those sniggering voices must not have been easy, but the Indian stepped it up on Chennai's show court to bridge the gap.A straight sets win (6-4, 6-3) in the first round of an ATP 250 event may not be much, but for Bhambri it was one step taken on a long and arduous journey ahead. At Nungambakkam on New Year's eve, Bhambri showed that he had the game and the tenacity to walk the remainder of that journey, with a strong and clinical performance.... contd.
It's a fair bet Michael Clarke won't be booed at the Sydney Cricket Ground this week when he sets out to become just the third Australia captain to achieve a 5-0 sweep over England in an Ashes series.Three years ago, Australian frustrations at their team's humiliation by a rampant England boiled over with some vociferous catcalling when Clarke, standing in for the injured Ricky Ponting, came out to bat in the fifth Test.Australia lost that series 3-1 with Clarke assuming the captaincy permanently not long afterwards and, although it has not always been a smooth path since, his team look more settled and confident than at any time in his reign.Victories by 381 runs, 218 runs, 150 runs and eight wickets  are Testimony to crushing Australian superiority in the first four Ashes Tests and Clarke's men will be going all out to drive home their advantage when the fifth gets underway on Friday."We want to win this match, we know we've got to do all the hard work and we're looking at this like a final," said pace bowler Mitchell Johnson, whose 31 wickets at an average 14.32 have been a key factor in Australia's"We know they are going to come out fighting hard. They're not going to want to lose 5-0."That fight back from a team that was number one in the world as recently as August 2012 has long been anticipated.The 3-0 home Ashes series triumph earlier this year and the two that preceded it in 2009 and 2010-11 are now distant memories and nothing in the performances in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Melbourne suggests England can turn things around in Sydney.Two key players are no longer with the touring party with batsman Jonathan Trott having returned home to deal with some psychological issues and spinner Graeme Swann retiring after the Ashes were relinquished in Perth.... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
The state government will soon undertake a census of the Great Indian Bustard, one of the most critically endangered flying bird species in the world, to ascertain its exact population. "The count of the Great Indian Bustard will be undertaken in January-February to know its population," Gujarat Principal Chief Wildlife Conservator of Forest C N Pandey said on Tuesday.Pandey said that it is expected to give a realistic picture of the dwindling population of the species. The survey count will be undertaken by the state forest department, various scientific organisations, NGOs and nature clubs. 
New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson scored the quickest century ever in international cricket on Wednesday, taking just 36 balls against West Indies to break the record long held by Pakistan's Shahid Afridi.Afridi scored a 37-ball hundred against Sri Lanka in 1996 and had remained the fastest across all formats of the international game since.Anderson, 23, brought up the mark with his 12th six of the innings after the third one-day international in Queenstown was reduced to a 21-over match due to rain.Fastest ODI 100sBalls36 C Anderson 201437 S Afridi 199644 M Boucher 200645 B Lara 199945 S Afridi 200546 J Ryder 2014#NZvWINew Zealand captain Brendon McCullum (33 off 11 balls) started the onslaught before Jesse Ryder (104), who completed his hundred in 46 balls, and Anderson added 191 runs for the fourth wicket."It's one of those things you don't plan on doing when you go out there but obviously with it (being) a reduced game it makes it easier to go harder at it earlier and Brendon showed his intent early on and Jesse played an unbelievable innings as well," Anderson said in a televised interview."I think we went pretty good together. I was hitting boundaries and he was hitting boundaries. It was just one of those things that comes off."I think me and Jesse were thinking every ball was going to get us out or go for six so it was nice to have that feeling out there and get them out of the middle."Anderson remained unbeaten on 131 off 47 balls with 14 sixes and half a dozen fours to take New Zealand to a mammoth 283 for four wickets in their innings.Asked if he was aware of the record, the left-hander said: "No. I didn't have a clue actually. It's not like I look it up and take it down but I guess it's nice to have that."
Police say an explosion in Prague has killed the Palestinian ambassador in the Czech Republic.Ambassador Jamel al-Jamal was in his apartment with his family at the time of the explosion on Wednesday, according to Palestinian Embassy spokesman Nabil El-Fahel.  Al-Jamal was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital, where he died, according to police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the blast occurred when the 56-year-old diplomat was moving an old office safe box.  It was not immediately clear how the explosives got there, and the ministry said the blast was being investigated.Prague rescue service spokeswoman Jirina Ernestova said al-Jamal was placed in a medically induced coma when he arrived at Prague Military Hospital. She said a 52-year old woman was taken to a different hospital in Prague after suffering from shock.The ambassador's apartment is in Prague's Suchdol neighborhood.
Retired Formula One champion Michael Schumacher's condition was stable overnight, but the brain injury he suffered during a skiing accident in the French Alps is still critical, his manager said Wednesday.Sabine Kehm told reporters that his condition has not changed since doctors said he showed small signs of improvement on Tuesday.Schumacher, who turns 45 on Friday, suffered critical head injuries when he fell and struck a rock while skiing. He has since undergone two brain operations and remains in a medically induced coma.''The good news for today is ... there's no significant changes,'' Kehm told reporters gathered outside the Grenoble hospital where he is being treated. ''However, it is still very early, and the situation overall is critical,'' she added.Doctors have refused to give a prognosis for Schumacher, saying they are focused on his immediate care. They are trying to reduce swelling in his brain by keeping him in a coma and lowering his body temperature to between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius (93.2 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit).Kehm said Schumacher was surrounded by his family and that there is always somebody with him.Schumacher is the most successful F1 driver in history, racking up a record 91 race wins. He retired from Formula One last year after garnering an unmatched seven world titles.His accident has drawn immense media attention, and Kehm confirmed Wednesday that earlier in the week security at the hospital stopped a journalist who was posing as a priest from approaching Schumacher.Schumi, as his fans affectionately call him, was famously aggressive on the track and no less intense off-hours. In retirement, he remained an avid skier, skydiver and horseback rider
Asking India to take advantage of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's "genuine interest" in improving ties, Pakistan's new envoy to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani has said New Delhi will "lose a big opportunity if they do not."Jilani, who had earlier served in the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, said Sharif had "genuine interest" in improving relations with India."They will lose a big opportunity if they do not," Jilani, the former foreign secretary, was quoted as saying by the Dawn.Speaking on Afghanistan, he said the complete withdrawal of American troops from the war-torn country is not desirable."Even the talk of US pullout has started having its impact. Pakistan has started to receive more Afghan refugees than before," he said. "This shows that the people of Afghanistan too have fears."The US plans to withdraw most of its combat troops from Afghanistan by December 2014, although it intends to leave behind a smaller force to help the Afghan government. The Pak-US relationship will enter a critical phase this year. The Pakistani security establishment fears that India will fill up the vacuum created by the withdrawal.Pakistan claims India is using Afghan territory for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, a charge denied by New Delhi.On the other hand, India is wary of Pakistan's role in post-2014 Afghanistan, especially the military's links with militant groups like the Haqqani network, as it believes this will give Islamabad impetus for re-starting the Kashmir jihad.Jilani, who reached Washington on Saturday, said his first priority would be strengthening trade and economic ties with the world's economic superpower."Defence and security ties obviously are equally important but cooperation in the energy sector would be the main task that one has to carry forward."He agreed with the suggestion that 2014 would be crucial for determining America's role in South Asia, but said it's still early to�speculate how the situation would shape up. ... contd.
Till death do us part! Archaeologists have discovered mysterious 3,500-year-old Bronze Age graves in Siberia, where male and female skeletons are buried facing each other and holding hands.Dozens of the ancient burials in Staryi Tartas village, in Novosibirsk region, contain the bones of couples, facing each other, some with their hands held together.Others show men or women buried with children, 'The Siberian Times' reported.Archaeologists hope that modern genetic tools and DNA tests will help shed some light in the next few years.Establishing genetic links between the bodies might help them understand why they were buried together.A number of theories have been fielded about these Andronovo burials. One such theory is that after the man died, his wife was killed and buried with him.Another version suggests that some of the couples were deliberately buried as if in a sexual act, possibly with a young woman sacrificed to play this role in the grave.One more theory is that, between 17th and 14th century BC, couples were probably buried together to emphasise the importance of nuclear families as a unit, even in death, so they demonstrate the importance attached by these ancient people to this form of relationship."We can fantasise a lot about all this. We can allege that husband died and the wife was killed to be interred with him as we see in some Scythian burials, or maybe the grave stood open for some time and they buried the other person or persons later, or maybe it was really simultaneous death," Professor Molodin, Director of Research of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said.
Kim Jong Un boasted Wednesday that North Korea enters the new year on a surge of strength because of the elimination of "factionalist filth" � a reference to the young leader's once powerful uncle, whose execution last month raised questions about Kim's grip on power. Kim's comments in an annual New Year's Day message, which included a call for improved ties with Seoul but also a warning of a possible "nuclear catastrophe," will be scrutinised by outside analysts and governments for clues about the opaque country's intentions and policy goals.Already widespread worry about the country has deepened since Kim publicly humiliated and then executed his uncle and mentor, one of the biggest political developments in Pyongyang in years, and certainly since Kim took power two years ago after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.North Korea's "resolute" action to "eliminate factionalist filth" within the ruling Workers' Party has bolstered the country's unity "by 100 times," Kim said in a speech broadcast by state TV. He didn't mention by name his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, long considered the country's No. 2 power.But Kim included rhetoric that some analysts saw as a first step to renewing dialogue with rival Seoul. Kim called for an improvement in strained ties with South Korea, saying it's time for each side to stop slandering the other and urging Seoul to listen to voices calling for Korean unification.That language, which is similar to that of past New Year's messages, is an obvious improvement on last year's threats of nuclear war, though there is still skepticism in Washington and Seoul about Pyongyang's intentions.North Korea's authoritarian, secretive government is extremely difficult for outsiders to interpret, and analysts are divided about the meaning of Jang's execution on treason charges. Many, however, believe that the purge shows Kim Jong Un struggling to establish the same absolute power that his father and grandfather enjoyed.... contd.

A Seven-day-old baby died of burn injuries due to overheating of the radiant warmer in the paediatrics ward of the Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital and Medical College here.Ishrat and Wasim, from Muzaffarnagar, had got their premature baby admitted to the hospital on December 28 on the reference of a nursing home at Shahpur tehsil where the baby was born. Doctors put the baby under the radiant warmer to help maintain body temperature. In the night, the doctors asked Wasim to take care of his baby as they moved to a nearby room for rest.Around 1.30 am, Wasim saw  smoke and called the doctors for help. But by the time the doctors turn off the overheated warmer, the baby had sustained 60 per cent burns. He was immediately shifted to the ICU where he died late Monday night. College principal Pradeep Bharti said, "The incident seems to have occurred due to short-circuit." He has formed a three-member committee to ascertain the cause of the death within three days. Bharti also blamed the lack of funds. "Machines here are old but we maintain them regularly. We cannot have new machines for paucity of funds and there is also a shortage of doctors and nurses to look after a heavy rush of patients in the hospital," he said.This is the second such incident. On April 24, a newborn baby died under the warmer at the hospital.
Proprietors of the first marijuana retailers licensed to sell pot for recreational use in Colorado were busy rolling joints and stocking up their leafy merchandise ahead of a grand opening on Wednesday that marks a new chapter in America's drug culture.Thirteen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers who are interested in nothing more than its mind- and mood-altering properties were slated to begin welcoming customers as early as 8 a.m. local time.When they do, they will be launching an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross $578 million in annual revenues, including $67 million in tax receipts for the state.Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters.But starting New Year's Day, cannabis will be legally produced, sold to the general public and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of Colorado.Due to the novelty factor, operators of the first group of retailers slated to open their doors in the Denver area and a handful of other locations were anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed.Inside a warehouse tucked away in the blue-collar Denver suburb of Northglenn, a trio of workers were feverishly rolling hundreds of marijuana cigarettes by hand in preparation for the onslaught."We expect to have 2,000 joints ready to go by the time we open," said Robin Hackett, 51, co-owner of Botana Care, who said she expects between 800 to 1,000 customers to patronize her store the first day.The store has hired a private security firm to help with traffic and parking issues that might arise.... contd.
Initiating its first action in the multi-crore StockGuru scam, the Enforcement Directorate has issued attachment orders on properties worth Rs 83 crore of main accused Ullas Prabhakar Khaire and his wife under anti-money laundering laws.The seized properties, spread out across the country in Maharashtra, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana, include some 'benami' immovable assets that the couple had allegedly purchased on fake identities.The agency, sources said, will soon issue prohibitory orders on these assets, including cash, jewellery and bank accounts, under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).ED took the latest action after it recorded the statement of the duo, lodged in Tihar jail in judicial custody, and went through the probe reports of other agencies.The agency's action to attach these properties under PMLA is aimed at depriving the accused of the benefits of these assets, alleged to have been accumulated through the "proceeds of crime" by duping investors.
A small aircraft Tuesday made an emergency landing on National Highway 69 near Betul and took off from the same place a couple of hours later. Amused bystanders and motorists had to wait as traffic was halted to facilitate the early morning landing.Sam Varma, a businessman who owns the Cessna aircraft, claimed the pilot was left with no other option because the tall light masts erected on the highway made it difficult for him to land the four-seater on the private airstrip located just off the highway.But the district administration did not buy the explanation and suggested that the emergency landing was an attempt to highlight the businessman's grouse against the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). Varma has been complaining about the tall masts since October when they first came up.The DGCA has started an inquiry into the incident, while the district administration has asked for a detailed report from Varma. Besides the pilot, Jaboc, there was one more passenger in the plane.Varma, himself a pilot, told The Indian Express that since October, planes have had to take off and land in only one direction to avoid the tall masts, but the high tailwinds on Tuesday made that impossible. He said he had informed the NHAI about restrictions on tall structures near the airstrip, but they did not yield. He said he had filed an FIR against the Nagpur-based NHAI project director for putting lives at risk.Betul collector Rajesh Mishra said he was waiting for a detailed report from Varma.Varma said the pilot had taken permission from ATC, Mumbai, before taking off. He said the pilot spoke to him over radio and discussed the possibility of landing in a nearby dam in a bid to avoid casualties on ground. Varma said he suggested the highway and spoke to police authorities who cooperated by stopping traffic.... contd.
The UP government Tuesday appointed 1978-batch IPS officer Rizwan Ahmad as the new Director General of Police (DGP). He is the first Muslim to assume the post in the state.Ahmad replaces  Deo Raj Nagar who retired Tuesday. Ahmad himself will have a short tenure as he is due to retire in February.Ahmad's name for the DGP's post was doing the rounds in the IPS circles since April when former DGP A C Sharma was on his way out. He had overseen arrangements of the iftaar party hosted by CM Akhilesh Yadav. However, Nagar was appointed as the DGP in April.The Akhilesh Yadav government's image has taken severe beating over the condition of post-riot relief camps where 34 children have died due to the cold.Sources in the government said the government was earlier hesitant in appointing Ahmad as DGP given that another Muslim officer, Jawed Usmani, holds the Chief Secretary's post. A native of Ballia, Ahmad was posted as Director General, Railways, since May after he he was shifted from the post of Director General (Telecom). On Tuesday evening, he said boosting the morale of police personnel and maintaining peace in the state will be his priorities.
Buoyed by victories in MP, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, it looks at 156 LS seats of UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka as key to 2014Firmly entrenched in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP  is looking at another set of three states that it believes holds the key to realising its Lok Sabha hopes for 2014."Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka are make or break for our 2014 dreams," stressed a BJP functionary considered close to prime ministerial candidate  Narendra Modi, speaking to The Indian Express days after the party won the assembly elections in the first three states.Not among the big targets is Bihar, which has 40 Lok Sabha seats and saw a bitter parting of ways with the JD(U). "Repeating or marginally bettering our tally without JD(U) support will be good enough, while larger gains will be a bonus," said the party leader. The BJP holds 12 seats out of the 15 it contested while in the alliance.In the states won, the BJP is banking on recent trends that have seen the party winning assembly polls frequently bagging most of that state's Lok Sabha seats, too. It is confident the leadership of Raman Singh, Shivraj Chouhan and Vasundhara Raje will take the burden off the central leadership.These three states account for only 65 Lok Sabha seats while UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka have 156. The BJP faces a Congress that has been holding its ground in Maharashtra and Karnataka and gained some in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha polls.Uttar PradeshIt is the obvious focus given its 80 seats. The BJP's first stint at power in New Delhi in 1996 had hinged on a robust performance in this state, though from 57 seats in 1998 (undivided UP) it slipped to 29 in 1999 following a rebellion by Kalyan Singh � who has since merged his party into the BJP. Close Modi aide Amit Shah, given charge of UP, has been consulting Kalyan on strategies to revive the party. Part of the strategy is nine mega rallies across regions by Modi, who has already held four and is slated to undertake three more and wind up in Lucknow before February-end when the actual campaign begins. Shah too has been touring the state and plans to visit at least 52 constituencies to put a setup in place. He has set the state organisation a target of 1.25 lakh booth committees.... contd.
India is preparing to participate in the UN-sponsored international conference on Syria to be held in Geneva which will bring together all warring parties, domestic and international, to resolve the crisis and stabilise the Arab country.India has been informed very "authentically" about its invitation to Geneva II, scheduled for January, and is awaiting a formal invite in this regard, Foreign Affairs' official spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said here Tuesday.Apart from financial assistance of US$1 million to the trust of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons at The Hague for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons and related facilities, India has also offered the services of its experts to help in the destruction of Damascus's chemical weapons arsenal and related facilities. India has maintained that the Syrian conflict should be resolved through dialogue, and has also said it does not support any military intervention by Western powers.India, Saudi to ink agreement on labourNEW DELHI: Saudi Arabia and India are set to ink an important agreement on labour cooperation when the kingdom's Labour Minister Adel Fakieh arrives on a three-day visit on New Year.

As the CPI (Maoist) begins preparations to celebrate the 10th year of its formation, memories of the last 12 months will haunt its members. Though they launched their biggest ever assault on a political convoy this year, it included one of three major tactical blunders whose repercussions continue to undermine their ideological highland. They also found their fighting prowess seriously questioned as they lost as many as 50 cadres in only six gunbattles dominated by security forces or splinter groups of their own former cadres, who lost only one member to the Maoists. The killings of PCC chief Nand Kumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel in the Darbha attack, and the separate murders of journalists Nemichand Jain and Sai Reddy in Bastar, have brought them widespread flak, even from their sympathisers. These were the first instances Maoists had killed journalists. The rebels had to apologise for Jain's murder saying it had been committed by their lower cadres, and admit that the killing of the Patels too was a mistake. Bastar journalists unanimously boycotted Maoists, while the People's Union for Democratic Rights' secretaries referred to the CPI (Maoist) constitution, a document considered sacrosanct by the rebels, and noted, "The two killings (of journalists) were carried out by the Maoists without even complying with the provisions of their own constitution. This raises a question if they take their own constitution seriously."In the two months preceding the May 25 Darbha attack, when the Maoists killed 27 persons including the Congress leaders, the organisation suffered huge losses in quick succession across its various zones. A Jharkhand-based ultra-Left outfit, Triteeya Sammelan Prastuti Committee, killed 10 Maoists in Chatra on March 28; the Gadchiroli police killed nine Maoists in two encounters in April; a joint team of Andhra Greyhounds, Chhattisgarh police and CRPF killed nine Maoists in Sukma the same month.  In July, the Gadchiroli police killed six women Maoists; in September, the Malkangiri cops killed 14 Maoists. ... contd.
Irked by RJD president  Lalu Prasad's visit to riot relief camps in Muzaffarnagar, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav called the former Bihar chief minister a stooge of the Congress."Every other person is doing politics over Muzaffarnagar riots. After being released from prison, he (Lalu) went to Muzaffarnagar. He is engaged in sycophancy of Congress," Mulayam lashed out at Lalu while addressing party workers at an event organised to observe the death anniversary of socialist leader Raj Narain here on Tuesday.Imitating Lalu's style, Mulayam said: "He says 'Rahul Gandhi is my leader, Sonia Gandhi is my leader'. Jao Congress ki chaploosi karo... He says 'Mulayam will not be allowed to become PM'. Earlier, I was not allowed to become the PM. It is not a new thing, everybody knows you. You are licking the feet of Congress, lick it."Continuing his tirade against Lalu, Mulayam said the RJD leader may side with any party even the BJP. "But SP does not compromise on its ideals for gaining power," he added.Lalu had visited relief camps of riot victims in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday and blamed the SP government of Uttar Pradesh for the poor condition of the people residing there. He even had called up Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav asking him to make proper arrangements in the camps. Mulayam countered it by saying the state government has provided maximum relief, which is "unprecedented" in the country. "Minorities are unhappy with the Congress. We have given compensation, accused will be punished," he stated.The acrimony between Lalu and Mulayam dates back to 1997 when Lalu had allegedly scuttled Mulayam's chances of becoming the PM after the then prime minister H D Deve Gowda had resigned. Mulayam also claimed that he will soon visit Bihar "as people of Bihar want him to tour the state".... contd.
On Monday night, when the temperature dropped to near zero in Muzaffarnagar district   and rain added to the chill, the district administration informed 300 families living out in the open for the last four months that they had 24 hours to pack up and leave.In adjoining Shamli, where riot refugees have been huddling in 12 relief camps, district authorities told community leaders "hosting" them that they had until January 4 to empty out the camps completely.Consequently, over Monday and Tuesday, 483 families piled their children and belongings together on 30-odd government tempos and trucks and left, pulling their buffaloes and goats alongside. Some 2,000 of those who left had fled from Fugana village, where the largest number of riot FIRs were registered, including six of gangrape.Some of them headed to the wet, muddy pieces of open land they have purchased in Loi or Neem Kheda with the Rs 5-lakh compensation the government has given them; others sought out a small bit of courtyard or a verandah in the home of a generous benefactor in Loi.Still others went in search of shelter in two rooms at a government school in Muzaffarnagar, or in the cluster of 70-odd houses that the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind is building in Khampur.On Tuesday, many of these families sat huddled at the bus stand in Neem Kheda, apparently with nowhere else to go. A few of the men struggled to erect cloth or plastic sheets above their heads; others simply sat or lay exhausted on charpais in the open, getting gently soaked in the fine rain that fell."Jab rakshak bhakshak ban jaye toh kya hoga? This time not only the state authorities but also the village pradhan turned against us. They said paperwork for the compensation could continue, but we needed to get off land owned by the government, and to protect ourselves from the cold.

Buoyed by victories in MP, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, it looks at 156 LS seats of UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka as key to 2014Firmly entrenched in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the BJP  is looking at another set of three states that it believes holds the key to realising its Lok Sabha hopes for 2014."Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka are make or break for our 2014 dreams," stressed a BJP functionary considered close to prime ministerial candidate  Narendra Modi, speaking to The Indian Express days after the party won the assembly elections in the first three states.Not among the big targets is Bihar, which has 40 Lok Sabha seats and saw a bitter parting of ways with the JD(U). "Repeating or marginally bettering our tally without JD(U) support will be good enough, while larger gains will be a bonus," said the party leader. The BJP holds 12 seats out of the 15 it contested while in the alliance.In the states won, the BJP is banking on recent trends that have seen the party winning assembly polls frequently bagging most of that state's Lok Sabha seats, too. It is confident the leadership of Raman Singh, Shivraj Chouhan and Vasundhara Raje will take the burden off the central leadership.These three states account for only 65 Lok Sabha seats while UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka have 156. The BJP faces a Congress that has been holding its ground in Maharashtra and Karnataka and gained some in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha polls.Uttar PradeshIt is the obvious focus given its 80 seats. The BJP's first stint at power in New Delhi in 1996 had hinged on a robust performance in this state, though from 57 seats in 1998 (undivided UP) it slipped to 29 in 1999 following a rebellion by Kalyan Singh � who has since merged his party into the BJP. Close Modi aide Amit Shah, given charge of UP, has been consulting Kalyan on strategies to revive the party. Part of the strategy is nine mega rallies across regions by Modi, who has already held four and is slated to undertake three more and wind up in Lucknow before February-end when the actual campaign begins. Shah too has been touring the state and plans to visit at least 52 constituencies to put a setup in place. He has set the state organisation a target of 1.25 lakh booth committees.... contd.
A 16-year-old girl, who was gangraped twice in a day around two months ago at Madhyamgram in North 24-Parganas district of West Bengal and had attempted suicide on December 23, succumbed to her injuries here on Tuesday. The victim was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata with 70 per cent burns after she attempted self-immolation in her house near Dum Dum, where her family shifted after the rape incidents.A gang of men raped the girl on October 25. Later the same day, when she was going home along with her father, a taxi driver, and her mother after lodging a complaint, she was again abducted by the same gang and raped, police said. She was found unconscious near the railway tracks.The family had settled in Madhyamgram a year ago, but shifted to Dum Dum after local goons threatened them with dire consequences if they didn't withdraw the rape case.On December 23, an associate of the gang leader barged into their Dum Dum residence and threatened them following which the girl tried to commit suicide.Her father alleged his daughter was not given proper medical treatment. "We repeatedly requested hospital authorities to shift her to the burn unit. But they did not pay attention to us," he said, adding that he has also lodged a case of medical negligence against hospital authorities. The father said nobody from the government visited the family.  "We want justice and we want that the criminals should be hanged," he said.The police have arrested seven persons in the case.
As Pressure mounted on Himachal CM Virbhadra Singh, the CBI Tuesday clarified that it cannot probe all the corruption charges leveled against him by BJP leader Arun Jaitley without a reference from the state government.CBI officials confirmed they have received a copy of the letter written by Jaitley to PM Manmohan Singh in which he made the allegations. The letter provides details of three cases, out of which two are being investigated by the agency. The third case, the officials said, will need a recommendation from the state government or a court direction to initiate a probe. The CBI will soon inform the PMO on Jaitley's allegations and the progress of the preliminary enquiry (PE) being initiated by it. Sources said the PE against Virbhadra is in final stages and the CBI has collected evidence to probe the case further. The first allegation relates to recovery of diaries by the Income Tax department from the Mumbai-based Ispat Group. The diaries allegedly revealed payoffs to various ministries and some of the entries were marked against the initials of 'VBS' and 'MoS APS'. There were allegedly four entries made against 'VBS', which totalled up to Rs 2.8 crore between October 2009 and October 2010. Virbhadra was steel minister between May 2009 to January 2011. Another allegation against Virbhadra is that a man identified as Anand Chouhan bought LIC policies in the name of the CM and family members totalling Rs 3.80 crore. Chouhan was recently questioned by the CBI for allegedly making deposit of several crores into the Punjab National Bank account in Shimla. The CBI said it will soon seek time from Virbhadra to examine him. "We plan to send a CBI team from Delhi to examine him. In the past, we have examined CMs on allegations of corruption by sending a team instead of calling them to Delhi," said a CBI official.  ... contd.
Congress state president Ramesh Chennithala would join the Oommen Chandy government on Wednesday in a pre-poll bid to indulge the upper class Hindu Nair community. Chennithala, a Nair, is slated to get Home, replacing Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, a Nair close to Chandy.Chennithala's cabinet entry has been in the air for several months but a decision was delayed as he was reluctant to accept any portfolio other than the home department. Chandy refused to part with home, held by his loyalist. Now, as the second-in-command in the cabinet, Chennithala would be breathing down his rival Chandy's neck. "Chennithala's cabinet entry has pending. Last week, the high command gave the final go-ahead. The party high command would decide who should become the state president," said Chandy.Nair Service Society, the outfit of Nair community, welcomed the decision with its general secretary Sukumaran Nair saying that an upper class Hindu in a key position in the government would augur well for the Congress. The NSS had insisted that Chennithala should be made a key figure in the government. It was not happy with Radhakrishnan holding Home despite he being a Nair too.Chennithala, who had repeatedly stated that the post of the party chief was several notches above that of a minister, on Tuesday turned a humble party worker. "I have never been after power. I'm just obeying the directives of party president Sonia Gandhi," he said.Indicating that Radhakrishnan would be retained in the cabinet, Chandy said, "Nobody from the cabinet is going out." Radhakrishnan is likely to get either sports or forest departments, now held by Chandy after K B Ganesh Kumar resigned following cases related to domestic issues.However, the bid to woo the Nair community has spelled fresh trouble for the UDF. Kerala Congress (B) chairman R Balakrishna Pillai, a director of NSS, said his son Kumar should be taken back as the minister. ... contd.
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said on Tuesday that while the "general impression" about BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is that he is "divisive", a section of people feels that he will be able to take "certain tough decisions... maybe positive ones" (on the Kashmir issue)."Modi has a mixed response (in the Valley). Some people don't like him, mainly because J&K is a Muslim majority state � not that there haven't been communal riots before Gujarat. Riots have taken place before Gujarat riots and after that too � in Assam and more recently in Muzaffarnagar. But when it comes to Gujarat, people saw the pictures and can't forget them," she said, speaking at the Idea Exchange programme at The Indian Express."But there is another section of people which probably thinks that maybe Modi is the one who will have such authority that he will be able to take certain tough decisions (regarding Kashmir issue). Decisions like Vajpayee took. Otherwise no other prime minister has ever taken any tough decision. When militancy was at its peak, he (Vajpayee) went to Lahore on the bus yatra. The same day, seven Hindu boys were killed... Even after Kargil, he invited the Pakistan President. And then Parliament (attack) happened," recalled Mufti."I think people have this impression that if Modi comes, he may be able to take certain tough decisions, maybe positive ones, because he did say at a rally in Jammu that he was going to follow Vajpayee's policies. But this impression is not shared by everybody, just a section. The general impression is that he is divisive," she said.On the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Mufti said, "Even the Kashmir Valley is celebrating this change of people who are not conventional politicians winning. Basically, in the Valley, the mainstream national parties are seen as untouchable because, firstly, they are seen as bad, and secondly, they are seen as being connected to Delhi. So, I think this example of AAP may make people change their mind... People may start believing that it (politics) is not so bad, it can have a positive impact too."... contd.
Veteran fighter pilot Arup Raha Tuesday took over as the 24th chief of the Indian Air Force, succeeding Air Chief Marshal N A K Browne. In a brief ceremony, Raha, 59, assumed charge of the IAF from Browne in the presence of senior officers, including new Vice Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal R K Sharma and Deputy Chief Air Marshal S Sukumar.Raha, who was born on December 26, 1954, will remain the IAF chief for three years.Raha, in his message to the 1.75 lakh-strong force, said the IAF is on a trajectory of modernisation and is transforming into a strategic aerospace power with full spectrum capability.

Dubai has ushered in 2014 with more than half a million fireworks spectacle, breaking the world record for the largest such display ever, Guinness World records said today.Ten months in planning, over 500,000 fireworks were used during the display on the New Year's Eve which lasted around six minutes, with Guinness adjudicators on hand to confirm that a new record had been set.Covering a distance of over 94km of the city's seafront, the display incorporated some of Dubai's top landmarks, including Palm Jumeirah, World Islands, the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab, Guinness said.The spectacle's final salvo of fireworks created an artificial "sunrise" along the seafront, with the highest fireworks reaching more than one kilometre in height.Organisers had been aiming to beat a record set in 2012 during a display to mark Kuwait's golden jubilee anniversary which saw a total of 77,282 fireworks launched.Dubai's attempt broke that benchmark by some margin, with enough fireworks launched within the first minute of the display alone to surpass the previous record.What now goes down as the biggest bang in the history of pyrotechnics was designed by US firm Fireworks by Grucci, said Guinness.The performance used 100 computers to synchronise the pyrotechnics, along with a choreographed musical soundtrack.In the build up to the event, more than 200 expert technicians worked 5,000 man hours to ensure that the fireworks' timing was accurate down to the millisecond."The scale of this record attempt is truly impressive and will ensure all eyes are on Dubai," Alistair Richards, Global President of Guinness World Records, said.Richards had travelled especially to Dubai from London to witness the display.
In line with Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's strategy to contain price rise in Congress-ruled states before the Lok Sabha elections, the Uttarakhand government has decided to keep fruits and vegetables out of the purview of Uttarakhand Agriculture Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act (UAPMA), 2011. A total of 93 agriculture produces (fruits and vegetables) were deleted from the notified list. This means no market levy will be charged on them.Chairman of Uttarakhand Agriculture Produce Marketing Board Shailendra Mohan Singhal said a notification was issued late on Monday night. "We will assess the impact of the decision on containing price rise," Singhal told The Indian Express. He evaded questions on revenue losses the board will incur following the decision. The board will lose Rs 8 to 9 crore per year because of the decision to exclude fruits and vegetables from UAPMA list. According to sources, the board's total income from mandies (wholesale markets) is around Rs 50 crore. Sources said the decision to exempt fruits and vegetables from market fees will not have a major impact on efforts to contain price rise. "It would hardly reduce prices of fruits and vegetables by two per cent. The mandies get about 2.5 per cent of the total price as market fee. Apart from this, the adhatis (commission agents) charge about 3 per cent from retailers or traders. It would be a difficult task for mandies to stop adhaties from charging commissions on purchases from farmers," a source said explaining problems the board would face after this decision. The decision is set to hit the plan to set up new mandies in hill areas. Two-thirds of Uttarakhand is hilly and mandies exist mainly in the plains. In the hills, there is little scope for foodgrain production. "The marketing board has initiated steps to set up mandies at least in seven places in hilly areas. At Karnaprayag, the mandy is in final shape," a source in the board said. According to him, the fund is raised from market fees the board earns. Mandies proposed to be set up in hilly areas have great scope for increasing business of fruits and vegetables, he added.
A day after fulfilling his promise to supply free water, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday kept his word to slash electricity prices in the national capital and audit the private power distribution companies. Following a meeting of the Delhi Cabinet, Kejriwal announced the government would provide a 50 per cent subsidy on power consumption up to 400 units a month. "As promised the AAP government  has slashed 50 per cent of the rates by giving a subsidy on the tariff. This will impact at least 28 lakh households in Delhi. Economically weaker sections of society will benefit from this decision," Kejriwal said.The subsidy is expected to cost the state Rs 200 crore per quarter until the end of the financial year in March. However, Kejriwal said it would cost Rs 61 crore. "Rs 61 crore will be given to Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited. But the remaining Rs 139 crore approximately will be given to government companies that are providing services and supply power to BSES Yamuna Private Limited and BSES Rajdhani Private Limited. And it will be adjusted from the accounts of BSES companies as they are yet to pay dues worth Rs 4,500 crore," the new chief minister said.Asked whether the government could give a subsidy when a regulator is in place, Kejriwal said: "The government has powers to give subsidy." Both discoms refused to comment on the subsidy when reached for their view. Kejriwal also announced a CAG audit into the finances of the three private power distribution companies. "The discoms have 24 hours to submit their objections on government views on the proposal for audit of their finances," he said. Kejriwal met CAG officials before chairing the Cabinet meeting and said the government auditor had in principle agreed to conduct the audit.... contd.
Seven years after the suicide spiral in Vidarbha's six cotton-growing districts touched a record 1,449 in 2006, here's something to celebrate the new year with: the number of deaths fell to about half that number in 2013.The year gone by recorded only 752 suicides , although that number could rise by a few due to some late reporting. It also reflects a markedly improving suicide-to-population ratio considering the significant growth in population in these seven years.The 2013 number has to be seen in relation to that of 2006 since meticulous reporting of all suicides � farmers and non-farmers � in the countryside began that year.The overall figures, generally reported as farmers' suicides, actually include suicides by men, young girls and boys and housewives from farmer and non-farmer households although suicides in farmer households are much higher.The Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, which maintains its own suicide-count, has recorded 824 suicides for 2013 from all 11 districts of the region, including the five that grow paddy.The record low in the number of suicides comes in a year that saw unprecedented havoc caused by rains in the region, killing hundreds of people and thousands of cattle and hurting farming in over 15 lakh hectares.The turnaround in the six cotton and soyabean producing districts of Wardha, Yavatmal, Amravati, Akola, Washim and Buldana, has coincided with concerted government interventions through the chief minister's and Prime Minister's packages - often dubbed failures - as also with the massive spread of Bt cotton, which now covers more than 95 per cent of the region's cotton area and which activists have been blaming for an "increase" in suicides. Almost all these districts have registered the drop consistently from 2006, barring 2010 which saw an increase. The drop has been most significant in Buldana (305 to 120) and Washim (185 to 56), two of the most backward districts of the region. In Amravati, it has gone down to 159 from 270 and in Wardha to 79 from 143. Yavatmal, which routinely registered the highest number of suicides, marked a drop to 219 from 359.... contd.
A fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami leader was Tuesday killed in Bangladesh in a clash with security forces as the opposition geared up for a non-stop nationwide blockade from the New Year to derail the January 5 polls.Police said local Jamaat leader Abdul Jabbar was killed in a clash between the opposition activists and joint forces, comprising paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and police, in western Meherpur district, bordering India."The members of the law enforcement agencies were injured in the gunfight," a police official told a TV channel.In the capital Dhaka, BNP activists took out processions and exploded bombs in old part of the city as it called for a nationwide protest Tuesday.The main opposition BNP led by Khaleda Zia Monday night called for the nationwide blockade of roads, railways and waterways after it was barred for the second consecutive day from staging the "march for democracy" in the capital.The BNP-led 18-party alliance has been demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and scrapping of the polls.BNP Chairperson's Advisor Khandker Mahbub Hossain said the non-stop nationwide blockade starting from January 1 would continue until further announcement.He asked opposition activists to stage "peaceful" protest rallies across the country Tuesday as a warm-up exercise.The opposition has dubbed the polls as "farcical" as over half of the candidates in the 300-seat parliament were set to be declared unopposed in the absence of rival contenders from the opposition.The alliance earlier enforced identical blockades for nearly a month from November 26 after the Election Commission declared the schedule for the polls amid stalemate over the nature of poll-time government.

A woman was allegedly stabbed and set on fire by a group of men, including a village sarpanch, in Ganjam district of Orissa on Monday evening. She succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday. Pranati Das (30), an owner of a public distribution system (PDS) shop, was at home in Sanaramchandrapur village in Rambha area of Ganjam on Monday when she was called out by two men. When she came out, "five people, including the sarpanch of the Sanaramchandrapur grampanchayat, stabbed her with a sword, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire," Ganjam SP Ashish Kumar Singh said. "She had shut her shop by 7 pm. There was a power-cut in the area and people were in their homes when the incident happened," he said.Das, who lived alone, was taken to MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town with more than 95 per cent burn injuries. As her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to a hospital in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh where she succumbed to her injuries Tuesday morning.The SP said the woman had, in her dying statement, accused the sarpanch of trying to get ownership of her shop. "There clearly was lot of  bad blood between the two. From her house, we recovered a couple of threatening letters from him (the sarpanch), asking her to to give up the dealership of the shop.""It would have been difficult for us to nab the accused had the woman not revealed their names in her dying statement. We have arrested four of the 5 accused. The case would be put up for fast-track trial," he said.

A 15-year-old youth, who was detained on Sunday for his alleged involvement in the twin terror attacks  in Hiranagar and Samba on September 26, had crossed over to India two-and-a-half years back, according to BSF officials."It is highly unlikely that he would have been involved in such a big terror attacks. He was going back to Pakistan as he was fed up with his life here. He told us that he had fled his country to escape penury, but he had to work here and was not given full meals," said Dharminder Pareek, DIG, BSF, Jammu. The youth, according to officials, was a fan of Bollywood films and wanted to become a hero."He says he crossed over to India when he was a little over 12 years old. It is unlikely that he would have been sent by his handlers more than two years ago to plot the attack," said another official. Another official said when they caught the youth, they did not find any cellphone or money on him, and he was wearing torn clothes. After preliminary interrogation, the BSF handed him over to Kathua police. Kathua SP Mohan Lal said, "Interrogation is still on." The police have obtained 10 days' remand and the youth will be interrogated by a joint team from the Intelligence Bureau, state police and BSF.A BSF official said the youth was working for a Gurjjar family at Hariyachak in Kathua. The Gurjjar, identified as Hassan Din, has been arrested for keeping the youth illegally with him. The youth, who is reported to be from Sahiwal district in Pakistan's Punjab, has reportedly told interrogators that he was not given any salary. He was reportedly on his way back to Pakistan when he was detained by a BSF team.... contd.
Asking India to take advantage of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's "genuine interest" in improving ties, Pakistan's new envoy to the US Jalil Abbas Jilani has said New Delhi will "lose a big opportunity if they do not."Jilani, who had earlier served in the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, said Sharif had "genuine interest" in improving relations with India."They will lose a big opportunity if they do not," Jilani, the former foreign secretary, was quoted as saying by the Dawn.Speaking on Afghanistan, he said the complete withdrawal of American troops from the war-torn country is not desirable."Even the talk of US pullout has started having its impact. Pakistan has started to receive more Afghan refugees than before," he said. "This shows that the people of Afghanistan too have fears."The US plans to withdraw most of its combat troops from Afghanistan by December 2014, although it intends to leave behind a smaller force to help the Afghan government. The Pak-US relationship will enter a critical phase this year. The Pakistani security establishment fears that India will fill up the vacuum created by the withdrawal.Pakistan claims India is using Afghan territory for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, a charge denied by New Delhi.On the other hand, India is wary of Pakistan's role in post-2014 Afghanistan, especially the military's links with militant groups like the Haqqani network, as it believes this will give Islamabad impetus for re-starting the Kashmir jihad.Jilani, who reached Washington on Saturday, said his first priority would be strengthening trade and economic ties with the world's economic superpower."Defence and security ties obviously are equally important but cooperation in the energy sector would be the main task that one has to carry forward."He agreed with the suggestion that 2014 would be crucial for determining America's role in South Asia, but said it's still early to�speculate how the situation would shape up. ... contd.
Proprietors of the first marijuana retailers licensed to sell pot for recreational use in Colorado were busy rolling joints and stocking up their leafy merchandise ahead of a grand opening on Wednesday that marks a new chapter in America's drug culture.Thirteen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers who are interested in nothing more than its mind- and mood-altering properties were slated to begin welcoming customers as early as 8 a.m. local time.When they do, they will be launching an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross $578 million in annual revenues, including $67 million in tax receipts for the state.Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters.But starting New Year's Day, cannabis will be legally produced, sold to the general public and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of Colorado.Due to the novelty factor, operators of the first group of retailers slated to open their doors in the Denver area and a handful of other locations were anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed.Inside a warehouse tucked away in the blue-collar Denver suburb of Northglenn, a trio of workers were feverishly rolling hundreds of marijuana cigarettes by hand in preparation for the onslaught."We expect to have 2,000 joints ready to go by the time we open," said Robin Hackett, 51, co-owner of Botana Care, who said she expects between 800 to 1,000 customers to patronize her store the first day.The store has hired a private security firm to help with traffic and parking issues that might arise.... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
Dubai has ushered in 2014 with more than half a million fireworks spectacle, breaking the world record for the largest such display ever, Guinness World records said today.Ten months in planning, over 500,000 fireworks were used during the display on the New Year's Eve which lasted around six minutes, with Guinness adjudicators on hand to confirm that a new record had been set.Covering a distance of over 94km of the city's seafront, the display incorporated some of Dubai's top landmarks, including Palm Jumeirah, World Islands, the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab, Guinness said.The spectacle's final salvo of fireworks created an artificial "sunrise" along the seafront, with the highest fireworks reaching more than one kilometre in height.Organisers had been aiming to beat a record set in 2012 during a display to mark Kuwait's golden jubilee anniversary which saw a total of 77,282 fireworks launched.Dubai's attempt broke that benchmark by some margin, with enough fireworks launched within the first minute of the display alone to surpass the previous record.What now goes down as the biggest bang in the history of pyrotechnics was designed by US firm Fireworks by Grucci, said Guinness.The performance used 100 computers to synchronise the pyrotechnics, along with a choreographed musical soundtrack.In the build up to the event, more than 200 expert technicians worked 5,000 man hours to ensure that the fireworks' timing was accurate down to the millisecond."The scale of this record attempt is truly impressive and will ensure all eyes are on Dubai," Alistair Richards, Global President of Guinness World Records, said.Richards had travelled especially to Dubai from London to witness the display.
The last year showed an India that is striving to reimagine itself � and where it is failing to.For India to look ahead, it must look again at Muzaffarnagar. Thousands of men, women and children who fled their homes after the communal violence in September to huddle in the cold in relief camps, are being urged by the administration to go back to the villages where their attackers still roam mostly free and unpunished. A government that failed to protect them from violence, which then sought to brazenly deny their suffering, is now abdicating its responsibility to provide them the sense of security, opportunity and space they desperately need to rebuild their lives. The desolate relief camps are a reproach to all the heady claims made for a new India's politics � that it is leaving behind its old divides and hatreds, that it is becoming younger and more forward looking, that governments are being coaxed to become more accountable because of more demanding citizens and an increasingly activist media and judiciary. The responsibility for the Muzaffarnagar shame must be owned by a government that is avowedly "secular", headed by a chief minister who was seen to signal a generational shift in his party and whose electoral victory was widely read as a vote for a more modern and development-oriented politics and government in Uttar Pradesh.Yet, as we step into 2014, something has changed, too. For one, the last year showed us that violence against women, for long a crime with no name, could be an issue that brings people out to the streets, to express outrage and demand justice. The brutal gangrape of a young woman in Delhi in December 2012 led to mass protests and eventually a change in law. The law is imperfect, informed by more impatience than deliberation, but it underlines that women's safety has assumed its rightful place as a mainstream, public issue. It will no longer be relegated. A similar urgency was vested in another old issue last year. Corruption became the plank that propelled a campaign's transformation into a political party and then the party of government, all in the space of a year. On corruption, as on sexual violence, for now the solutions are informed by more righteousness and rage than rigour. But there is hope that the complacence and cynicism about politics-as-usual is being pierced, and that this will lead to something better.... contd.
AAP's water policy ignores the poor, subsidises middle class, turns its back on the need for water reform.Starting today, the new government of Delhi will deliver on one of its biggest promises. Citizens can use up to 667 litres of water a day for nothing, what Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal calls "lifeline water", a common claim to an essential resource. But despite the easy appeal of the policy, it is fiscally unwise, short-termist, and ignores the poor who lack access to piped water �  nearly half of Delhi, given that there are only 17 lakh metered connections in the city. It lavishes free water upon those who can afford to pay, and should pay �  given that there are costs involved in constructing reservoirs, maintaining pipelines, providing infrastructure and human resources. In effect, that tab will now be picked up by the state, and could involve cutting back public spending or imposing taxes on the average citizen. In the new water policy, any drop that exceeds the free amount, in the next slab of 20-30 kl, would entail a higher bill of Rs 870. Given that water meter readings are not difficult to manage, this steep tariff climb is an invitation to distortion and waste. Instead, a responsible government that knows Delhi's water problem first hand would have tried to manage demand, and to expand the water grid to those who are not served.The city is perennially parched, dependent on neighbouring Haryana, Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand. What makes it worse is systematic mismanagement of the resource � approximately 52 per cent of water is lost because of the Delhi Jal Board's (DJB's) leaky distributional pipeline. Genuine reform would involve bulk-metering systems, technology-aided monitoring at every stage, investment in treating and recycling water, improving pipelines and switching to a graded model that imposes a minimal cost on everyone, and climbs higher depending on use. It would involve bringing water to the seven lakh or so households that are now left out or dependent on an extractive tanker mafia, and making supply more reliable.... contd.
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said on Tuesday that while the "general impression" about BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is that he is "divisive", a section of people feels that he will be able to take "certain tough decisions... maybe positive ones" (on the Kashmir issue)."Modi has a mixed response (in the Valley). Some people don't like him, mainly because J&K is a Muslim majority state � not that there haven't been communal riots before Gujarat. Riots have taken place before Gujarat riots and after that too � in Assam and more recently in Muzaffarnagar. But when it comes to Gujarat, people saw the pictures and can't forget them," she said, speaking at the Idea Exchange programme at The Indian Express."But there is another section of people which probably thinks that maybe Modi is the one who will have such authority that he will be able to take certain tough decisions (regarding Kashmir issue). Decisions like Vajpayee took. Otherwise no other prime minister has ever taken any tough decision. When militancy was at its peak, he (Vajpayee) went to Lahore on the bus yatra. The same day, seven Hindu boys were killed... Even after Kargil, he invited the Pakistan President. And then Parliament (attack) happened," recalled Mufti."I think people have this impression that if Modi comes, he may be able to take certain tough decisions, maybe positive ones, because he did say at a rally in Jammu that he was going to follow Vajpayee's policies. But this impression is not shared by everybody, just a section. The general impression is that he is divisive," she said.On the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Mufti said, "Even the Kashmir Valley is celebrating this change of people who are not conventional politicians winning. Basically, in the Valley, the mainstream national parties are seen as untouchable because, firstly, they are seen as bad, and secondly, they are seen as being connected to Delhi. So, I think this example of AAP may make people change their mind... People may start believing that it (politics) is not so bad, it can have a positive impact too."... contd.
The Jammu and Kashmir State Accountability Commission � set up to probe charges of corruption against ruling politicians � on Tuesday ordered a regular inquiry against Minister for Consumer Affairs & Public Distribution, Choudhary Mohammad Ramzan.Ramzan had allegedly encroached on a green belt and a portion of the road to construct a palatial bungalow which was in violation of the design approved by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation.The commission, including Chairperson Justice U P Nargotra and Justice Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain, noted that the minister had not rebutted the allegations that he encroached upon colony land and a portion of the road despite being issued a notice. They held that his continuous absence and failure to file a response, prima facie raises the presumption that the complaint against him is correct. While ordering that a complaint be registered against Ramzan, the commission also issued him a notice asking him to appear before it and file a defence statement within six weeks.The allegation was leveled by housing society, Friends Enclave Consumer cum Welfare Cooperative Humhama Heights, Srinagar, through Dr G N Yatoo and accused the minister of violating the design approved by Srinagar Municipal Corporation.Ramzan is the second minister in Omar Abdullah's Cabinet to face a regular inquiry by State Accountability Commission. In May, it had ordered an inquiry against Deputy CM Tara Chand for making illegal appointments in urban local bodies department, which was earlier headed by him.
A special Goa court Tuesday acquitted all six accused in the 2009 Diwali eve bomb blast case in Margao town. Special court judge Pradip Sawaikar acquitted all the accused for lack of evidence against them. Two of the other accused who were ferrying the explosives to a crowded spot where the low intensity blast occurred, were the only ones killed in the explosion. The accused � Vinay Talekar, Dhananjay Ashtekar, Prashant Ashtekar, Vinayak Patil, Prashant Juvekar and Dilip Mazgaonkar � were arrested by Goa crime branch. 
A day after BJP leader Arun Jaitley levelled allegations of corruption against him, Chief Minister  Virbhadra Singh rushed to Delhi Tuesday afternoon. The Himachal CM's unscheduled Delhi visit came amidst speculation about the Congress high command summoning him after the opposition's stiff demand for his ouster.On arrival in Delhi on Tuesday, the Himachal CM claimed that the allegations  were a "malicious campaign" by the Opposition. His wife, Pratibha Singh, who has also been accused of corruption, visited the AICC headquarters and met senior party leaders.While developments in the Congress show that the party leadership has been put in a tight spot over the charges, sources said Virbhadra may be given some time and asked to explain his position.Before flying to Delhi, Virbhadra is reported to have requisitioned files related to hydel projects including Saikothi (15 MW) project, which was allotted to Venture Energy and Technologies Ltd. Two Cabinet ministers, Sudhir Sharma (Urban and Housing) and Mukesh Agnihotri (Industry and Public relations), also accompanied Virbhadra to Delhi.Meanwhile, former Himachal CM and Leader of Opposition in the state Prem Kumar Dhumal maintained that if Virbhadra does not resign, the central and state BJP leadership will meet President Pranab Mukherjee and seek his removal.In a statement in the evening, Virbhadra refuted the allegations levelled by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Jaitley. "It is clarified that that Ispat Industry people have never met me except for once. I have never received any favour from them during my tenure as steel minister and neither any favour had been done to the firm during my period," he said.About his alleged favours to a certain power project, Virbhadra said it was the erstwhile BJP government that gave the project an extension. "On the other hand my government has taken a decision of cancelling the project thereby upholding the rule of law," he said.... contd.
Seven years after the suicide spiral in Vidarbha's six cotton-growing districts touched a record 1,449 in 2006, here's something to celebrate the new year with: the number of deaths fell to about half that number in 2013.The year gone by recorded only 752 suicides , although that number could rise by a few due to some late reporting. It also reflects a markedly improving suicide-to-population ratio considering the significant growth in population in these seven years.The 2013 number has to be seen in relation to that of 2006 since meticulous reporting of all suicides � farmers and non-farmers � in the countryside began that year.The overall figures, generally reported as farmers' suicides, actually include suicides by men, young girls and boys and housewives from farmer and non-farmer households although suicides in farmer households are much higher.The Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, which maintains its own suicide-count, has recorded 824 suicides for 2013 from all 11 districts of the region, including the five that grow paddy.The record low in the number of suicides comes in a year that saw unprecedented havoc caused by rains in the region, killing hundreds of people and thousands of cattle and hurting farming in over 15 lakh hectares.The turnaround in the six cotton and soyabean producing districts of Wardha, Yavatmal, Amravati, Akola, Washim and Buldana, has coincided with concerted government interventions through the chief minister's and Prime Minister's packages - often dubbed failures - as also with the massive spread of Bt cotton, which now covers more than 95 per cent of the region's cotton area and which activists have been blaming for an "increase" in suicides. Almost all these districts have registered the drop consistently from 2006, barring 2010 which saw an increase. The drop has been most significant in Buldana (305 to 120) and Washim (185 to 56), two of the most backward districts of the region. In Amravati, it has gone down to 159 from 270 and in Wardha to 79 from 143. Yavatmal, which routinely registered the highest number of suicides, marked a drop to 219 from 359.... contd.
The Gujarat government on Tuesday granted Nanavati-Mehta Commission, that is probing the 2002 Godhra train carnage and subsequent communal riots in the state, extension till June 30, 2014 for submitting its report. Constituted on March 6, 2002 to probe the Godhra train carnage on February 27, 2002 and the subsequent communal riots in Gujarat, the Commission had sought "some more time" to submit its report. This is the 21st extension the Commission has got from the state government to complete its probe and submit a report. C G Patel, secretary of the Commission, said, "Today, we have received a communication through fax from the state government whereby the Commission has been granted extension till June 30, 2014." 
Camera manufacturers are a worried lot. The improvement in phone cameras have over the past few years eroded almost all of their business in the point and shoot range. Almost everyone clicks pictures these days, but not all are using something that has been built exclusively for the purpose. This is why innovation has become the key to survival in the camera business. Nikon pushed the envelope a bit too far when it launched the D800 with a 36MP sensor, Canon was silent for a while before it thought of the ultra compact 100D. But since then, most of the innovation has happened from Sony, not exactly the first name that comes to your mind when you think of cameras. They launched the stunning RX1, a compact camera with a full-frame sensor, the RX100s that took compact cameras to a whole new level and now the new Sony Alpha a7 and a7R DSLRs, both full-frame mirror-less cameras in very manageable sizes. I put the Sony a7 to the test. Design  The design reminded me a lot of the RX1. In fact, the body is not much larger even though this is a full-frame DSLR. But the RX1, the great camera that it is, would develop a serious complex in front of this one. That is because this has a tiltable LCD panel, a proper eye piece though looking into an electronic OLED viewfinder and whole range of lenses to play with. It is compact, but build like a Colt with a body that will weather most storms, and dust storms, that come its way. All the ports are tucked away behind sturdy flaps. Despite the small built, the camera offers a very steady, DSLR-like, grip. There is a thumb rest near where all the controls are settles. There is a ring here to adjust the settings and another on up front accessible with your fingers. While framing a shot, both these will come in more than handy. There are two customisable buttons that maker life much easier. Plus, you can switch between auto focus and auto exposure lock on the body itself. I would have preferred this to have been a switch for manual focus. ... contd.
At the end of the first day's play in Johannesburg, India had batted themselves into a decent position. The score read 255/5, their position looking even more robust because their captain was still at the crease. The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to not just set his record right in conditions outside the subcontinent. This was his chance to ride home the advantage for his team. It wasn't to be though as Dhoni perished, poking at a Vernon Philander delivery leaving him. One that could have been left alone. His dismissal for 19 also set in the rot as India lost their four wickets for not much.It wasn't the only time Dhoni set off a collapse or got out just when the situation called out for him to play a knock of significance. At Durban in the first innings, he and Ajinkya Rahane had helped India regain control with a 50-run stand for the fifth wicket. They had also taken India past the 300-run mark. Then Dhoni, batting on 24, went chasing after another length delivery outside his off-stump with his unique 'walking shot'. This time from a charged-up Steyn. Yet again the Indian skipper had fallen in the same fashion as has become customary of him in conditions where the ball moves around. The most disappointing of the lot was reserved for when India needed Dhoni the most. On the last day of the tour with the visitors hanging by the skin of their teeth to save the second Test and ensure that they walk away with a 0-0 verdict �which would have been akin to a win for India.The South African pacers had just finished their umpteenth spell on the day. Manning the attack now was Robin Peterson bowling from over the wicket into the rough, and hardly turning a ball. Just then Dhoni decided to use his forearms and muscle a length delivery outside his leg-stump over the mid-wicket fielder. Not only was the shot not on, it was also uncalled for considering the situation, especially with Rahane fighting tooth and nail at the other end to keep India's hopes alive. The ball only went as far as Alviro Petersen at mid-wicket. Dhoni could only throw his head sideways in despair. Soon after, the Indian tail lived up to their reputation and was blown away.... contd.
Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari  Tuesday refuted reports of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's imminent resignation. He also added that Rahul Gandhi is the "natural leader" of the Congress."This (reports of PM's resignation) is baseless and without facts. I don't want to lend decorum to such questions by reacting to them. Rahul Gandhi is the natural leader of the Congress party, but as the UPA chairperson has said, if required we will declare a PM candidate in time," Tewari said. His remarks came a day after Congress leader and Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the party should declare its PM candidate.Tewari was speaking at the launch of the Directorate of Advertising & Visual Publicity's calendar for 2014. The calendar highlights the achievements of the UPA government, such as MGNREGA, Food Security Aadhaar, etc.Tewari conceded that the results of the recent Assembly elections had disappointed the Congress, but the party was ready to take on the 2014 "challenge"."To some extent, people seemed to be overawed by the results of the Assembly elections. Yes, for us as a party, maybe as a government they have been disappointing. But if you look at them in perspective, out of 29 states that went to polls in the past five years, the Congress won twelve," he said.Tewari also objected to the use of the phrase 'secular tourism', used by the BJP to describe Rahul's visit to Muzaffarnagar, and said it reflects a "narrow mindset".
The US  is still reviewing the application for the transfer of senior Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade to UN and issue the necessary documents to her for full diplomatic immunity, a top American official said."It is under review. We cannot predict when that review will be complete," said a State Department spokesperson in response to a question on the status of the UN request to grant full diplomatic status to 39-year-old Khobragade.The State Department had received her application from the  United Nations in New York on December 20. Normally, the State Department takes a decision on this very quickly, but this time the US  is taking an unusually long time."We cannot compare this to previous requests as each request is evaluated on its own merits," the spokesperson said on Tuesday.Khobragade was arrested on December 12 on charges of visa fraud and misrepresentation. At the time of her arrest, she was Deputy Consul General at the Indian Consulate in New York. The US says, in this capacity, she did not had full diplomatic immunity.Days after her arrest, the Indian government transferred Khobragade to the permanent mission of India to the United Nations (UN), with the view that this would give her the necessary diplomatic immunity.India has strongly objected to her arrest, and in protest has withdrawn many of the diplomatic privileges granted to the American diplomats in India.As one enters the New Year, the Indian diplomat continues to remain in the US without diplomatic immunity. She is currently on bail bond of USD 250,000 and her passport is in possession of the court.
In her first public statement in the two-week-old India-US spat over the treatment of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York, the US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell Tuesday said she regretted the circumstances of Khobragade's arrest even as officials in America indicated charges against the IFS officer would not be withdrawn.Powell's statement, which was weaved into her new year's message, was seen as an attempt to assuage India's concerns as the furore over the alleged mistreatment of Khobragade has soured relations.New Delhi responded by saying it would communicate with Washington through the designated channel, the State Department in this case, and that it remained serious about pursuing misuse of diplomatic privileges by US diplomats in India."I join Secretary Kerry in expressing our regret for the circumstances of the consular officer's arrest, but we believe that we can look forward to continuing to expand our bilateral relations," Powell said in her message, referring to a similar expression of regret by Secretary of State John Kerry in the days after the row erupted.Referring to various "impressive developments" between India and the US in a wide-range of areas, she said this "forward movement has been jolted by very different reactions to issues involving one of your consular officers and her domestic worker".Senior US officials in New York had late on Monday rejected India's contention that salary details in the visa application of Khobragade's domestic help had been misconstrued and asserted there is "no goof up" and that the case against her is on a firm footing.The officials said the visa fraud charges against Khobragade will not be dropped as "the strength of the fraud in the case is very strong"."The case will be there against her, it will not be dropped. The charges will remain," the sources said, adding that if the 39-year-old diplomat gets full diplomatic immunity, she can travel outside the country. ... contd.
In 2013, India failed to manage important bilateral relationships, or to communicate the rationale of foreign policy initiatives.Was 2013 the annus horribilis for Indian foreign policy? Foreign policy formulation and implementation by definition require meticulous planning, attention to detail and clinical and mature assessments. Some of these qualities were not in full evidence during the course of the year. The events of 2013 provide pointers to a few trends. First, the management of the more important bilateral relationships, particularly those in our immediate neighbourhood and with the United States, requires extra effort and skilful handling not only with the countries concerned but also with domestic constituencies, including the media and state governments. The required margin of persuasion with domestic constituents does not appear to have been used in 2013. In many cases, there was a failure to communicate the rationale of policy initiatives, even when these were sound. The management of our relations with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is a case in point. In the case of the former, the failure to persuade domestic constituencies, particularly the chief minister of West Bengal, will prove to be costly, in both the short and medium terms. In Sri Lanka's case, we failed to encourage Colombo to move away from majoritarianism and be more responsive to and ensure Tamil interests.With Pakistan, the year started badly. The barbaric beheading of an Indian soldier inside Indian territory in January, the murder of Sarabjit Singh in a Pakistani prison in April-May and the killing of five Indian soldiers by Pakistani special forces in August brought relations to a boil. Firing along the Line of Control almost threatened the 10-year-old ceasefire. Domestic passions were inflamed and provided just the opportunity some members of our strategic community required to indulge in Pakistan-bashing. There was little or no evidence that the new political dispensation in Pakistan either wished to turn a new leaf  or had the clout to rein in the terror machine. The need to keep channels of communication open is not an issue. What was and should continue to be the decisive determinant is timing. The prime minister should have been discouraged from meeting his counterpart in New York. Strong political opposition domestically, particularly from the BJP, scaled down expectations.... contd.
*  This refers to 'Kejriwal govt opens freebie floodgates: 667 litres daily' (IE, December 31). Arvind Kejriwal is quite lucky since, unlike Mamata Banerjee who took over the reins from the ossified Left Front government in West Bengal, he has inherited a cash-rich administration from former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. But he is also unlucky as the Delhi government has to coordinate quite a bit with the Centre. It is imperative that Kejriwal use public money judiciously. The aam aadmi has many needs that are still to be met. The granting of 667 litres of free water per day to households will only benefit people with piped water connections and water meters. Kejriwal must prioritise reaching out to that section of Delhi's population which has no water meters to begin with. He should aim to provide piped water to everyone.� B.N. AnandMohali*  Why is the AAP providing free water to people who who can afford to pay for it? Meanwhile, millions of people without piped water connections will continue to wait for the water tankers. The culture of freebies may win some votes but it will be economically and socially disastrous.� P.L. DharDelhiUnsung hero*  This refers to the editorial 'King Kallis' (IE, December 31). There is no doubt that Jacques Kallis is one of South African cricket's unsung heroes. As is Rahul Dravid in India and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the West Indies. If we compare Kallis's performance statistics with those of iconic players like Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar, he is definitely a notch ahead of them. It would be futile to compare Kallis with the legendary Garry Sobers � the times during which they played were too different. Sobers was the best all-rounder of his era. But if you compare Kallis to acclaimed all-rounders of the recent past � Ian Botham, Imran Khan, Richard Hadlee and our very own Kapil Dev � there is no doubt that Kallis is king.... contd.
A new democratic experimentalism is in the air.India's great churning will continue in the coming year. There is new momentum towards change. The momentum will be most manifest in glimpses of a new institutional order that is coming into being. India's progressive moment is now beginning to find its feet, with a clamour for a governance architecture that is more horizontal, transparent, decentralised, based on public reason and allows for new political formations to emerge. This process will continue. The flotsam of the old order will continue to be visible, and will often disguise the new undercurrents forming. More poison may come out of the system as partisan competition intensifies. But amid all the high-decibel exchanges, a quiet revolution will continue. But the revolution will be most palpable in a subtle reorientation of attitudes. The most besetting sin of Indian democracy over the last couple of years has been its corrosive cynicism. It was a cynical democracy with much to be cynical about. But the cynicism had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Few believed anything could change, so little changed. There were no texts, there were only subtexts. Virtue was nothing but deception. We converted it into such an art form that there was cynicism about everything that pretended to be anything other than cynicism. The cynicism was compounded by what Amartya Sen has made India's badge of self-identification: the argumentative Indian. We thought arguing was generally a good thing, since it denoted a kind of freedom and engagement with learning. But we forgot the other side. An argumentative person is someone who goes on arguing, well after the matter has been settled. Much of our public argument had this character. It was not argument in the interest of learning; it was argument in the interest of going on and on. Few who came to the argument were open to being persuaded, few were open to any possibilities other than what they had already committed to.... contd.
Ruchira GuptaAn open letter to Indian women, a year after December 16, 2012.Dear Sisters,Congratulations. You've survived this far. You have forged a large and diverse movement in 2013 that has resulted in a stricter law against male sexual assault and made visible women's oppression at home and in the workplace. You have broken the silence against your oppressor, even though they were your friends, colleagues, brothers, and fathers. You have found the courage to overcome your so-called shame and stigma and finally shifted the blame to your abusers � in Goa, Gujarat, Delhi, Maharashtra and West Bengal.You have survived being called a man-hater, a family-breaker, revengeful, frigid, shrill, divisive, ugly, and "not feminine." You've paid the personal price, when you confronted your father for assaulting your friend, or your boss for assaulting you. You've survived men yelling, "This law is too strict, women are falsely accusing us." You have survived bitterness, when your abuser got off scot-free and you were told you seduced him by wearing the wrong clothes. You have survived guilt for not being a "good" mother or "good" wife. You have succeeded in facing off a conservative backlash from a society that wanted you to stay indoors after dark, wear certain clothes, behave in a certain way and not give you jobs because you were female. You have shown those who said they would fear hiring you as their secretary, that you would now be the Boss looking for a secretary � male or female.You've endured despair, when only the failures felt real � when the numbers of repeated and continued rape seemed unrelenting and when feminist victories got conveniently dissociated from feminism � when some people declared that over the past 30 years, the Women's Movement "didn't care about" class, caste, homophobia, the environment, men, or that the women's movement was different from other movements against inequality.... contd.
Despite its commitment to meet the target for 2013-14, the Centre's fiscal health deteriorated further in November with the fiscal deficit shooting to 93.9 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE) as tax collections and disinvestment proceeds fell short of target.Even more worryingly, both the revenue and primary deficits has exceeded the Budget projections at 103.5 per cent and 171.8 per cent of the BE  respectively between April and November 2013.Data released by the Controller General of Accounts revealed that the the Centre's fiscal deficit stood at Rs 5,09,557 crore or 93.9 per cent of the BE of Rs 5,42,499 crore between April and November. It was significantly lower at Rs 4,12,926 crore a year ago.Finance minister P Chidambaram has called the target of 4.8 per cent, a "red line" that will not be breached. The target is also being monitored by global rating agencies who have warned that any fiscal slippage could lead to a rating downgrade for India."Fiscal consolidation in the past has been driven by growth in revenue but this year, revenue receipts are not as plentiful. We expect the fiscal deficit at 5.1 to 5.2 per cent in 2013-14 but this could be lower depending on the quantum of expenditure compression by the government," said DK Pant, chief economist at India Ratings. But flagging tax receipts that amounted to Rs 3,96,166 crore or just 45 per cent of the BE of Rs 8,84,078 crore could pose a challenge. Finance ministry officials said that indirect tax collections may fall short of target by Rs 41,000 crore. But an improvement is expected in direct tax receipts in December with advance tax payments.
As it heralds a new year, Asia is waking up to a very different Japan. After decades of pacifism and strategic marginalisation, Japan is now shaking up the region's geopolitics by responding vigorously to China's rise. The talk of a war between Japan and China might be excessive, but the mounting tension between the two is now part of the region's political landscape.India, which hosts Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations later this month, must come to terms, like the rest of the region, with Tokyo's determination to shape the Asian security order. After he returned to power a year ago, Abe has set about transforming Japan's military strategy. He has proposed a 5 per cent increase in defence spending to $240 billion for the next five years. While approving more money for defence, Abe is aware that Tokyo can never match Beijing's rapidly growing defence budget or the size of the PLA. He, therefore, wants a military doctrine that will leverage the Japanese lead in technology, focus on Chinese vulnerabilities and let Tokyo stare Beijing in the eye.In a recently released document on national security strategy, the first ever in Japan, Abe has underlined the importance of a "dynamic deterrence" and "active defence" against the growing Chinese military challenge. Japan will now develop a marine corps of its own, integrate unmanned drones into defence plans, strengthen its capacity for real-time military intelligence, and respond effectively and immediately to Chinese intrusions into the disputed air and maritime spaces.Abe is complementing changes in the military strategy with policy change and institutional innovation. He wants to lift the ban on Japan's arms exports in order to strengthen the domestic defence industrial base. He is trying to dismantle the many self-imposed political constraints on Japan's ability to cooperate with other nations in securing the region from military threats.... contd.
Political killings in West Bengal are part of the overall strategy of the ruling Trinamool Congress to browbeat all opposition through strong-arm methods of terror and intimidation, says the editorial in the CPM's People's Democracy. Comparing the current situation with the times of political violence in the 1970s, it says that the state is "menacingly moving towards a situation reminiscent of the semi-fascist terror unleashed... during the decade of the 1970s."Supporting its claim, the editorial also enlists "political crimes" in the state, purportedly at the TMC's behest since 2011. According to the statistics presented, there have been 142 political killings, over 200 rapes, 89 farmers' suicides, over 7,400 people evicted from their homes, over 4,200 arrests based on false charges, etc. "It is, indeed, ominous that such an attack on democracy and civil liberties in West Bengal comes at a time when there seems to be a rightward shift in Indian politics. It is well-known that the Trinamool Congress has absolutely no reservations or any compunctions in doing business with the RSS/ BJP," it says, adding, "It would, therefore, be of little surprise if the projected RSS/ BJP prime ministerial aspirant receives positive vibes from the West Bengal CM."CORPORATE STOOGELike the "fake encounter specialists", who brutally kill innocent people in manipulated encounters, UPA 2 has its own hitmen, who serve the interests of corporates and other looters of national and natural wealth, says the CPI in the editorial of New Age. Doing an analysis of Jayanthi Natarajan demitting the office of environment minister recently, the write-up says she was removed by the prime minister to serve corporate interests. It says Natarajan's replacement, M. Veerappa Moily, has been sent to the environment ministry because the UPA wants certain projects cleared, which were earlier stalled due to environmental considerations. "He (Moily) is doing overtime work to clear all the cases. He claims that he `clears' all files by evening the day it is put to him. Really a smart and loyal servant of Corporate Houses..." ... contd.
Syed Ata HusnainOn India-Pakistan, the good news is that the armies are talking.It is good to see the trust reposed in the director-general of military operations (DGMO) to stabilise, if not resolve, a tricky military-to-military relationship, which more often than not transforms into a tricky nation-to-nation relationship. But what do such meetings really achieve, and how should they be handled? This time around, it's been all about the Line of Control (LoC) and the frequent flare-ups which threaten to trigger greater tension with Pakistan.The DGMO meeting is not a flag meeting. Flag meetings are at the level of local commanders or staff. They take place on either side of the LoC or border, as the case may be. They are not part of the political dialogue but are just border conferences to temporarily dilute a military standoff in a situation where political parleys are not possible. Unlike a political dialogue, it does not take much effort to organise a flag meeting. Sometimes, they can be held for a specific purpose, not linked to the LoC or to border tension. However, the usual flag meetings at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and LoC are held to de-escalate a crisis situation. A flag meeting between general officers is rare � it remains pegged at the level of colonel or brigadier to keep the agenda local. It does not resolve an issue and neither should it be expected to � unless it is to hand over or take back someone who has unwittingly crossed the LoC. This is because the agenda is usually contentious and the participants are not empowered to dilute the established positions. There have been times when firing has recommenced in the vicinity of a flag meeting, even as the local commanders returned to their respective sides after the meeting. Lasting solutions to even local problems are almost impossible.... contd.
STEVEN LEE MYERSTwin terrorist attacks in the city of Volgograd within 24 hours injected new urgency Monday into Russia's long, ruthless effort to contain a diffuse Islamic insurgency on its southern border, one nominally led by a veteran, battle-scarred Chechen called Russia's Osama bin Laden.The attacks, coming only six weeks before the opening of the Olympics just 400 miles away, sowed widespread fear across the country.The investigation into the bombings is just getting underway, but the attention of the Russian security services is already focused on the republic of Dagestan, which has become the hub of Muslim separatist violence in recent years, and on connections to the insurgent leader, Doku Umarov. He is a mysterious, almost mythical figure who fought in both Chechnya wars, which began nearly two decades ago and have come to symbolize the radicalization of a movement that began as a struggle for independence.Umarov's influence had seemed to be waning in recent years, until he surfaced in a video in July, ordering his followers to do whatever was possible to attack Russia as it prepared to be the host of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Volgograd, Umarov's threats, largely ignored at the time, suddenly seemed ominous, chillingly citing Russia's transportation networks as potential targets.Now, experts say, the question is whether the suicide bombings in Volgograd and one previous attack there are the first volleys in Umarov's promised campaign to disrupt the Olympic Games and discredit the government of President Vladimir V Putin."The big question is will there be this sort of wave," said Gordon M Hahn, a senior associate with the Centre of Strategic and International Studies. "This is already a pretty high level - the fact that they pulled off three suicide bombings in Volgograd in two months. If their idea is to build up a crescendo, they have to take it easy because they'll have to do something really big."... contd.
A fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami leader was Tuesday killed in Bangladesh in a clash with security forces as the opposition geared up for a non-stop nationwide blockade from the New Year to derail the January 5 polls.Police said local Jamaat leader Abdul Jabbar was killed in a clash between the opposition activists and joint forces, comprising paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and police, in western Meherpur district, bordering India."The members of the law enforcement agencies were injured in the gunfight," a police official told a TV channel.In the capital Dhaka, BNP activists took out processions and exploded bombs in old part of the city as it called for a nationwide protest Tuesday.The main opposition BNP led by Khaleda Zia Monday night called for the nationwide blockade of roads, railways and waterways after it was barred for the second consecutive day from staging the "march for democracy" in the capital.The BNP-led 18-party alliance has been demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and scrapping of the polls.BNP Chairperson's Advisor Khandker Mahbub Hossain said the non-stop nationwide blockade starting from January 1 would continue until further announcement.He asked opposition activists to stage "peaceful" protest rallies across the country Tuesday as a warm-up exercise.The opposition has dubbed the polls as "farcical" as over half of the candidates in the 300-seat parliament were set to be declared unopposed in the absence of rival contenders from the opposition.The alliance earlier enforced identical blockades for nearly a month from November 26 after the Election Commission declared the schedule for the polls amid stalemate over the nature of poll-time government.
Two teenagers were Tuesday charged with brutally attacking and robbing a 20-year-old Indian student in Australia, who suffered serious head injuries in the incident.Manrajwinder Singh from Reservoir remained in an induced coma in a hospital here after being bashed up by thugs early Sunday.Singh, in Australia to study accounts, was sitting with two other friends near the footpath east of Princess Bridge when they were approached by eight men, according to a police statement.The offenders, perceived to be of African appearance, assaulted Singh by kicking him on the head and hitting him with a stick.A 17-year-old Sydenham boy has been charged with intentionally causing serious injury, robbery and theft, the Victoria police said in a statement.He faced an out of sessions court hearing Tuesday and has been remanded in custody to appear at a children's court on January 2.Earlier, a 16-year-old St Albans boy was charged with serious assault and remanded in custody.The teen was recognised by Protective Services Officers (PSO) from media coverage of the incident, the statement said, adding the PSOs arrested the boy just before midnight at Sunshine Railway Station.The third arrest in the case, a 15-year-old Ascot Vale boy has been released and is expected to be charged on summons.A search is on for five others believed to be involved in the incident. The police have appealed to the public for any information to contact them.The incident was described as a cowardly attack by Detective Senior Constable Adam Foley."It was just an opportunistic target from the offenders, they've just seen them there and approached them and done what they've done," Foley said.Singh's brother Yadwinder Singh, meanwhile, pleaded for justice. "They hit him on the head and he is in coma. I couldn't believe it. My brother should get justice; he is fighting for his life," he said.
The output of eight key infrastructure industries bounced back 1.7 per cent in November, primarily due to better performance of cement and electricity generation. This might signal a reversal of the downturn.The output of the core sector comprising crude oil, coal, natural gas, fertilisers, steel, cement, electricity and refinery products had contracted in October.The data released by the government on Tuesday showed that the cumulative growth in these industries during the April-November period stood at 2.5 per cent compared to 6.7 per cent during the same period a year ago.This group has a weight of 37.90 per cent in the index of industrial production (IIP),  the gauge of industrial activity in the country. It had fallen 0.6 per cent in October.Electricity generation, witnessed an increase of 5.9 per cent as against 1.3 per cent in October and 2.4 per cent in November last year. Cement production expanded 4.2 per cent during the month compared to a one per cent growth in October and a contraction of 0.2 per cent year-on-year.Economists have interpreted the number has a revival in industrial activity, but cautioned that it is likely to remain mild going forward."It will have some impact on IIP. We expect mild growth to continue in the second half, indicating some kind of industrial revival but there should not be expectation of a stellar recovery," DK Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research, said. IIP data for November will be released on January 12. Index for industrial production contracted 1.8 per cent in October 2013 while it remained flat during the April-October period. Production of coal, crude oil and steel also showed some growth during the month. Coal production grew 2.3 per cent compared to a contraction of 3.9 per cent in October and a contraction of 2.9 per cent year-on-year. ... contd.
At the end of the first day's play in Johannesburg, India had batted themselves into a decent position. The score read 255/5, their position looking even more robust because their captain was still at the crease. The stage was set for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to not just set his record right in conditions outside the subcontinent. This was his chance to ride home the advantage for his team. It wasn't to be though as Dhoni perished, poking at a Vernon Philander delivery leaving him. One that could have been left alone. His dismissal for 19 also set in the rot as India lost their four wickets for not much.It wasn't the only time Dhoni set off a collapse or got out just when the situation called out for him to play a knock of significance. At Durban in the first innings, he and Ajinkya Rahane had helped India regain control with a 50-run stand for the fifth wicket. They had also taken India past the 300-run mark. Then Dhoni, batting on 24, went chasing after another length delivery outside his off-stump with his unique 'walking shot'. This time from a charged-up Steyn. Yet again the Indian skipper had fallen in the same fashion as has become customary of him in conditions where the ball moves around. The most disappointing of the lot was reserved for when India needed Dhoni the most. On the last day of the tour with the visitors hanging by the skin of their teeth to save the second Test and ensure that they walk away with a 0-0 verdict �which would have been akin to a win for India.The South African pacers had just finished their umpteenth spell on the day. Manning the attack now was Robin Peterson bowling from over the wicket into the rough, and hardly turning a ball. Just then Dhoni decided to use his forearms and muscle a length delivery outside his leg-stump over the mid-wicket fielder. Not only was the shot not on, it was also uncalled for considering the situation, especially with Rahane fighting tooth and nail at the other end to keep India's hopes alive. The ball only went as far as Alviro Petersen at mid-wicket. Dhoni could only throw his head sideways in despair. Soon after, the Indian tail lived up to their reputation and was blown away.... contd.
With high inflation eating into workers' savings, trade union leaders who dominate decision making at the Employee's Provident Fund Organisation have demanded a 9 per cent  return on retirement savings for FY14 even as the organisation wants to continue with 8.5 per cent. The issue will be taken up when the EPFO's apex decision making body � the Central Board of Trustees meets on January 13, after a gap of 11 months. "With high inflation and high interest rates, the government should also offer a higher return on PF deposits," said AK Padmanabhan, member, CBT and president, Centre of Indian Trade Unions. "There has to be some increase in PF rates to protect the value of the workers' savings," says another leader. In last fiscal year, the EPFO offered an 8.5 per cent return on the provident fund deposits of workers in the private organised sector.  In 2013-14, the EPFO is estimated to have earned Rs 20,796.96 crore of which Rs 20,740 crore will be used to pay 8.5 per cent interest to its subscribers.An 8.5 per cent interest would leave the retirement fund manager with just about Rs 57 crore surplus in 2013-14 while even a 50 basis point hike would require an additional Rs 1,000 crore in the fiscal."We would have liked to pay a higher interest rate to subscribers who are already reeling from high inflation but it has to be in proportion with our returns," said a senior EPFO official. Apart from the interest rate, the Trustees in the first such meeting this fiscal, are also expected to take up a host of proposals including a revamped investment pattern for the EPF. The new pattern, which is based on the finance ministry's investment pattern for pension and provident fund trusts, 2008, envisages raising the cap on investments in PSU and private sector corporate bonds to 55 per cent but has refrained from investing in equities.... contd.
India's external debt declined by $9 billion to $400.3 billion at the end of September 2013 with government debt component at $77.3 billion."At end-September 2013, India's total external debt stock stood at $400.3 billion, recording a decline of $ 9 million over the level at end-March 2013," said a finance ministry release.

A 35 year old Nepalese man has been arrested for tattooing the likeness of his friend's wife on his chest, the first case of its kind in the country.Kumar Kesi from Kavre district east of Kathmandu claimed that his love had grown after he tattooed the woman's picture on his chest."Kumar has been kept in police custody under the Public Offence Act as there is no law related to the act of tattooing a woman's picture," police officer Arun Kumar Bisi said.According to police, the case is the first of its kind in the country.Kumar said he fell in love with the woman after she was introduced to him by her husband four years ago. "We began to love each other after our meetings," he claimed.Kumar had used a photo given to him by the woman some years ago for the tattoo, which features the woman with her hair tied and a big 'tika' on her forehead.After he showed off the tattoo to his friends during Diwali last year, word about it spread like wildfire.He said: "She used to meet me in Banepa and Kathmandu on the pretext that she was ill, and had to go for check up."Kumar and the woman's husband were dump truck drivers at a local industry.The husband forced his wife to disclose their relationship and filed a case against Kumar. Following the complaint, police arrested Kumar recently.15 Indian-origin men, women on Queen's Honours listLondon: Fifteen Indian-origin men and women, including prominent educationist Asha Khemka, have been named in Queen Elizabeth's New Year's Honours List for 2014.Khemka has been named a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her service to the deprived areas of the West Midlands as principal of West Nottinghamshire College for the last eight years.

The Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) is likely to take up three hydro power projects at its next meeting. These projects have been held up on account of environmental and forest clearances.The three hydel projects � Tawang (800 MW) and Tato (700 MW) and Teesta (520 MW) � have been awaiting environmental clearances for a very long time."These projects in Arunachal Pradesh (Tawang and Tato) and (Teesta) Sikkim have been sent to CCI from the power ministry for clearance," said a source. He said the CCI may take up the proposals at its next meeting but did not specify a date for that.Teesta Stage-IV Hydroelectric Project is a run of the river scheme proposed along river Teesta. The project was awarded to NHPC in 2009. At that time the estimated project cost was Rs 3,594.74 crore.The project, which is likely to supply electricity to Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand, was expected to be commissioned in 2012.The Tawang Hydroelectric Project is proposed on Tawangchu river. The estimated project cost at the time of award was Rs 6,112.30 crore. The 700 MW Tata hydro power project in Arunchal Pradesh is being set up by Tato Hydro Power Private Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Power.
Prabhat Kumar, joint secretary in the civil aviation ministry, has been given the additional charge of of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh is learnt to have cleared Kumar's name for the DGCA after the prime minister-headed Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) failed to announce a candidate to fill the DGCA's post after Arun Mishra left.The civil aviation ministry has sought ACC approval for Kumar's appointment as the DGCA for a period of three years. "The minister gave the additional charge to Prabhat Kumar since the ACC order did not come till the end of the day of December 31, 2013," said a senior civil aviation ministry official. He added that Kumar will take charge on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Airports Authority of India chairman VP Agarwal, whose term was ending on Tuesday, got a three-month extension. "Agarwal's extension is dependent on a clearance from the Central Vigilance Commission and he gets a three months extension until CVC clearance or denial comes in," said a ministry official.In another development, Ashok Lavasa will take charge as the new civil aviation secretary after incumbent KN Srivastava retired on December 31. Lavasa is a 1980 batch IAS officer of the Haryana cadre.
Gold was steady in thin year-end trade on Tuesday on course for its biggest annual decline in 32 years as prospects for global economic recovery prompted investors to switch to riskier assets.After a 12-year bull run gold has shed around 28 per cent in 2013, with the US Federal Reserve's plan to step away from ultra-loose monetary policy undermining the investor case for holding bullion.Years of accommodative monetary policies had propelled the price of gold to all-time highs of $1,920.30 an ounce in September 2011, as low interest rates encouraged investors to put money into non-interest-bearing assets.Spot gold was up 0.6 per cent to $1,202.30 an ounce at 1046 GMT, while US gold futures for February delivery fell 0.2 per cent to $1,201.90 an ounce.In wider markets, world stocks were ending 2013 close to six-year peaks and benchmark bond yields were poised for their first annual rise since 2009 as investors celebrated a pick-up in global growth with expectations of more to come.The dollar was also on track to end 2013 modestly higher against a basket of main currencies.Gold was also set to post hefty annual losses in other currencies, with prices in euros down 31 per cent on the year, the first fall since 2004. Prices fell 30 per cent in Swiss francs and 29 per cent in British pounds.
The national selectors, on Tuesday, sprang a surprise by naming uncapped all-rounder Stuart Binny in the 16-member squad for the five-match ODI series in New Zealand that starts at Napier on January 19. Binny replaces Yuvraj Singh, the out-of-form all-rounder who was instrumental in India winning the 2011 World Cup. Yuvraj in his last 8 outings had scored 118 runs.Binny, whose father Roger was part of India's 1983 World Cup winning team and is presently one of the selectors, had been a stand-out performer for Rajasthan Royals in last season's Indian Premier League. The medium pacer cum lower order batsman scored 293 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 147.23 and took six wickets with an economy rate of 6.75. Turning up for Karnataka, he has cored 281 runs from six Ranji Trophy games and took 11 wickets. This comes after a dream 2012-13 season when the 29-year-old finished with 612 runs at 47.07 and took 19 wickets at 41.89.With New Zealand expected to welcome India with green-tops, there was a school of thought that the selections should pick a technically proficient specialist who had the skills to negotiate the moving ball. After scoring 280 runs in two Tests in South Africa, Cheteshwar Pujara was the man. But by going for a a bits and pieces players, it is clear the Pujara doesn't seem to be figure in the scheme of things as the selectors look test players for the next year's World Cup that will be jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia.Pujara's List A average is 54.57 in 68 matches. He scored 199 runs in five List A games when he led India A to a tri-series in South Africa in August. Binny, on the other hand, has a List A average of 22.30 in 48 matches, though it has to be said he bats down the order. He also has 37 wickets at 36.64. In the three matches he played for India A in South Africa he scored six runs.... contd.

Her party's only MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Manth constituency Shyam Sunder Sharma will be the TMC candidate from Mathura. Sharma is learnt to have assured the party of victory and the party has no reason to not believe him. In fact, encouraged by the TMC's good fortunes in recent panchayat polls in Bengal, Mamata has decided to field candidates in Kerala as well. TMC second in command, Mukul Roy, inaugurated the party's state headquarters in Kochi last week.VACANCIES AT MHATop slots in the MHA are falling vacant with the ministry set to lose two more top bureaucrats who are returning to their cadre ahead of the general election. Additional secretary from Tamil Nadu K Skandan has gone back to his cadre while K A Ganai, additional secretary, is also moving back to J&K cadre. Skandan, who was handling charges of Centre-states relations and J&K was instrumental during the creation of Telangana while Ganai was handling foreigners, police modernisation, UT division in the ministry. The MHA, however, appears to be in no hurry to fill the slots. It is still to pick candidates for these two posts even as another post of special secretary (internal secretary) is lying vacant for the past three months.MISSING THE ACTIONBureaucrats it seems are loathe to miss their vacations no matter what else they might miss.

French doctors treating Michael Schumacher for brain injuries sustained in a ski fall said the seven-times Formula One world champion was in slightly better condition on Tuesday after an overnight operation, but he remained fragile.The 44-year-old German is battling for his life after slamming his head against a rock while skiing off-piste in the French resort of Meribel on Sunday, an accident which triggered an outpouring of concern among fans around the world.Doctors treating him at a hospital in the eastern city of Grenoble said his condition had stabilised enough by late Monday to carry out a new operation to treat the effects of internal bleeding within Schumacher's skull."The situation is more under control than yesterday but we cannot say he is out of danger," Jean-Francois Payen, head anaesthetician, told a news conference at the CHU hospital in the eastern French city of Grenoble."We have won some time but we must continue an hour-by-hour surveillance... It is premature to speculate on his condition," he said, adding that Schumacher was still in a critical state and suffering from severe lesions and contusions.Emmanuel Gay, head of the hospital's neurosurgery service, said the operation carried out around 10.00 pm (2100 GMT) on Monday had successfully removed a large hematoma - the medical term for a build-up of blood - from his brain."It was larger and more accessible (than others) ... We judged we could remove it without taking any risks," Gay said.He said the operation was designed to reduce the pressure on the brain.Helmet crucialDoctors said the fact that the retired motor racing champion was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident had at least enabled him to make it to the hospital alive.Payen said the medical team in Grenoble had discussed the operation with Schumacher's family. He added that the condition of the motor racing great was still too fragile to consider transferring him to another hospital for the time being.... contd.
The year-ending loss at Durban meant India had now lost their third successive overseas Test series. But even the harshest of critics will say that the defeat to South Africa was unlike the previous two 4-0 humiliations in England and Australia. This young Indian team had shown that they were ready for a fight. That they were game to face adversity head-on and not back down. And it wasn't surprising to hear that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni talk about how in his opinion, India had exceeded expectations. "It was a fantastic performance but yes we could have done better. The batting looked good, bowlers worked hard. When the pitch offered something, like in Johannesburg, the pacers were able to get the opposition out. It was a great exposure for most of the batsmen and bowlers who were touring for the first time," he said. Like always, he also had his unique take on how his team had gone. "With this side, all ingredients are there. This series we didn't cook the food well. But apart from that we have got fantastic ingredients just have to make sure we are cooking in the right way," he added. Dhoni wouldn't have been the only one to admit that India had exceeded expectations. They had after all gone into the Test series as virtual no-hoppers. Not many gave them a chance to get back up after the pummeling they took in the three ODIs. Rain in Centurion had saved them the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash after all. The batsmen had looked all at sea against the South African pace barrage while their bowlers had been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a baby-faced assassin in Quinton de Kock. And as India slumped to 24/2 on the first morning at Wanderers after Dhoni had elected to bat first, the alarm bells were well and truly ringing. ... contd.
Skipper Sami Aslam (108) made a century as Pakistan colts held on to their nerves to pull off a narrow two-wicket win over India in the Under-19 Asia Cup here on Tuesday. Pakistan chased down a challenging 251 with just three balls to spare and registered their third straight win of the tournament.Riding on Ricky Bhui's quick-fire half-century, India scored 250 for seven off their quota of 50 overs after electing to bat at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. India got off to a solid start with openers Ankush Bains (41) and Akhil Herwadkar (31) putting on 74 runs in 13.3 overs.  However, Pakistan leg-spinner Karamat Ali brought his side back into the match as he removed the top-three batsmen, including skipper Vijay Zol (20) to reduce India to 116 for three.Ali kept a tight leash on the Indian batters as he finished with figures of four for 28 in his 10 overs. Bhui put on small but significant partnerships of 36, 42 and 45 with Sanju Samson (38), Sarfaraz Khan (20) and Deepak Hooda (24) to take side to a testing total. Ricky's 66-ball-64 included three fours and two sixes. In reply, left-handed Aslam led from the front as he smacked Indian bowlers to all parts of the ground. He laid the foundation for his side and put on 72 runs with Hasan Raza (30) for the third wicket. Aslam 119-ball knock included 11 fours and a six. Kamaran Ghulam (55) then took on the mantle to take his side to the finishing line.But two consecutive wickets - Ghulam off the final ball of the penultimate over and followed by another on the next delivery - made the contest intriguing.Pakistan required five off five balls to seal the match, which Zafar Gohar (8 not out) achieved by hitting consecutive boundaries of Chama Milind. Both teams have already qualified for the semi-finals in which India will meet Sri Lanka on January 2 while Pakistan will clash against Afghanistan on the same day.... contd.
Arsenal can complete a quick double over managerless Cardiff City and consolidate their position at the top of the table when the relentless Premier League holiday schedule continues on New Year's Day. While players and fans in other countries have a rest from soccer over the holidays, Wednesday's matches will be the fourth in little over 10 days in England.With the campaign at the halfway mark after 19 matches, Arsenal, with 42 points, lead the table at the start of the new year for the first time since the 2007-08 season. They are followed by Manchester City (41), Chelsea (40) and Everton (37). The race is so close that Liverpool, who were top at Christmas, are now fifth on 36 points after two defeats in four days at Manchester City and Chelsea.Brendan Rodgers's side, who are at home to Hull City, are only two points clear of both champions Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, who meet at Old Trafford on Wednesday.The situation is even tighter at the other end with only seven points separating 11th-placed Swansea City (21) and table-propping Sunderland, who gained a point at Cardiff on Saturday in a 2-2 draw.Serena sweats it out, wins season-openerbrisbane: World number one Serena Williams looked rusty in her first competitive match of the season ahead of the Australian Open but battled through to beat Andrea Petkovic 6-4 6-4 at the Brisbane International on Tuesday. The number one seed won in 98 minutes to reach the quarter-finals but her 36 unforced errors and 55 percent serving accuracy showed how much Williams has to work on with the first grand slam of 2014 less than a fortnight away.German Petkovic was exactly what the defending champion needed at this point in the season. She ensured the five-times Australian Open winner had to fight for every point across both sets.... contd.
Opening batsman Chris Rogers wants an unchanged Australian team for the fifth and final Ashes test as a reward for the eleven players who beat England in the first four matches to emphatically wrest back the urn.The hosts have played with the same team since the start of the series in November and they will head to Sydney eyeing a whitewash when the match starts on Friday. "We've had some good stability," Rogers, who struck a sparkling century to fire Australia to a dominant eight-wicket win in the fourth Ashes test, told reporters on Tuesday."I just think it would be nice to have that same 11 standing on the podium at the end. The guys who have been here this whole series deserve to be there so it would be nice if we can keep that same team."Paceman Ryan Harris and all-rounder Shane Watson bowled sparingly in the second innings in Melbourne as they managed respective knee and groin complaints but are expected to be fit for Sydney.Australia lost 3-0 in the year's first Ashes series in England and few would have seen the reversal Down Under.Off-spinner Nathan Lyon said the hosts' ruthless performance did not come as a surprise to him and he also expected to be part of an unchanged Australia team. "We knew it was coming to be honest," Lyon said, adding that Australia were thinking nothing other than winning the series 5-0. "Yes England beat us over there 3-0 but it was a lot closer over there."We had opportunities but we fell over at the line and here in Australia we've won the bigger moments and won them pretty well."It's been a big reward for what we went through in England."  Meanwhile Andy Flower has said he'll be telling the new England Cricket Board managing director when they meet this week that he wants to continue contributing as a national coach despite the Ashes series debacle in Australia.... contd.
It is inevitable that the latest call-up to the Indian ODI squad, Stuart Binny would face additional scrutiny for being the son of selector Roger Binny. However, at least on the day he made the cut for the New Zealand tour, Binny Junior, gave enough and more testament to his ability with a game-changing knock albeit in a different format. Coming into bat with his side both stuck in first gear on a tricky Feroze Shah Kotla pitch and precariously placed at 73/4 after 35 overs, Binny resurrected the innings, hitting six sixes and seven boundaries in a 94-ball 88. Binny would be dismissed with Karnataka two runs short of Delhi's first innings total 202, but his side eventually took the first innings lead and at stumps were comfortably placed at  226/5.While Binny's knock essentially pulled the rug from under Delhi's feet. The hosts needed to win the game to have any chance of progressing to the knock outs, were hamstrung from the start of the day.  Poor visibility delayed the start for close to two hours and it stayed bad enough for umpires to force spinner Varun Sood and military medium Rajat Bhatia to bowl first, instead of Ashish Nehra and Sumit Narwal, who would have been best-placed to take advantage of overcast conditions. Bhatia though delivered for Delhi by bowling opener Mayank Agarwal in his first over. Eventually the light improved enough for Nehra to be introduced, and the pacer got R Samarth pulling to Sood at square leg. The pitch wasn't giving much turn but had no pace on it either, forcing batsmen to generate all the power. In addition the ball was keeping low and through two such deliveries, Varun Sood got last match's centurion Manish Pandey and Abrar Kazi out LBW. ... contd.
These have been a frustrating few weeks for Iqbal Abdulla. Despite some decent performances under his belt, like his four-wicket haul against Punjab, the selectors continued to give the left-arm spinner a cold shoulder repeatedly pointing out he wasn't up to the mark. However, with Mumbai playing at Gujarat and under pressure to win and qualify for the knockout stages, the selectors persisted with the tried-and-tested spinner. Perhaps, his past performance at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium here worked for him. His last five-wicket haul had come at this venue against the same opposition back in 2008.On Tuesday, Abdulla repaid the selectors' faith and justified his selection by picking up six wickets in the do-or-die game, keeping Mumbai's hopes of making the quarter-finals alive. Defending a meagre total of 154, Abdulla's fine spell marginally helped apply the skid-breaks on Gujarat and stop them from running away with the game as they notched up 253, a lead of 99. At stumps on Day Two, the visitors were 76 for four, still trailing by 23 runs, and staring at the steepest challenge of the season.But earlier on Tuesday, realising they needed quick wickets to stand any chance of making a comeback, Mumbai began on a bright note with medium-pacer Shardul Thakur removing Parthiv Patel soon after play began. Then, it was the time for Abdulla show.Ever since Mumbai found another left-arm spinner in Vishal Dabholkar last season, Abdulla's spot in the starting XI has been uncertain. Experts suggested he was more suited to the T20 format as he lacked variations and did not have a traditional spin bowlers' approach.However, he proved them wrong on Tuesday. He kept up the pressure from one end and looked the only bowler who could run through Gujarat's line-up. Abdulla added to his overnight tally by trapping opener Samit Gohel in front of stumps. Manprit Juneja, who himself is going through a rough patch, started well but was caught at slips by Wasim Jaffer off Abdulla. The left-armer didn't have much trouble finishing off Gujarat's tail-enders Chirag Gandhi, Rakesh Dhruv and Ishwar Choudhary.... contd.
*   The bombings in Russia serve as a chilling reminder of what the Winter Olympics represent to terrorists: a high-profile target with more than 2,500 athletes waving the flags of nearly 90 nations. While many Olympic leaders called for calm the day after two bombings about 400 miles from Sochi killed at least 31 people, some of the athletes heading to Sochi spoke of a different reality -- their security is never sure thing. U.S. speedskater Jilleanne Rookard said she was concerned but believes the Russians will have things locked down. Russian Olympic leader Alexander Zhukov said the bombings didn't spark a need for additional security measures because "everything necessary already has been done".Fulhamappoint Wilkins*   English Premier League strugglers Fulham have appointed former manager Ray Wilkins as assistant to new boss Rene Meulensteen to aid their battle against relegation. Meulensteen was only appointed manager at the start of December after stepping up from the role of head coach, which he held for a matter of weeks, to succeed the sacked Martin Jol. This addition follows the appointment of ex Charlton Athletic and West Ham United boss Alan Curbishley as technical director. "I am delighted that the Chairman and the CEO have, again, backed my desire for further experience and support within the backroom staff," Meulensteen told the club's website of Wilkins, who has managed Fulham before.Sunderland swoop for Alonso*   English Premier League basement dwellers Sunderland have moved quickly to reinforce their frail defence by agreeing a loan move for Fiorentina fullback Marcos Alonso until the end of the season. The 23-year-old former Real Madrid, Bolton Wanderers and Spanish under-19 defender will officially complete his move to Wearside when the January transfer window opens on Wednesday. "Marcos is a player that I have known well for a very long time," Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet told the club's website on Monday. "He was desperate to come and play for Sunderland and he is a player I am excited to work with." Poyet has made new signings a priority.... contd.
Every year, kids with big forehands and bigger ambitions, are subjected to a plethora of voices. Some voices are from within, others they can do without. The players who find success at an early age, few in number, are usually the ones that managed to weed out the wrong from the right.Yuki Bhambri was one of those few.In 2009, at just 17, he was the Australian Open boys' singles champion � a junior Grand Slam champion, just like Bernard Tomic had been in the previous year in Melbourne and Grigor Dimitrov had been in the previous year in New York.But while Tomic and Dimitrov soon found their calling as professionals with career high rankings in the low 20s, the voices had caught up with Bhambri.When Dimitrov and Tomic boasted of reaching the third round and quarterfinals of the French and Wimbledon respectively, Bhambri � who is yet to make the main draw of a Slam � played hard to make the second round of the Chennai Open. Before this week began, he had gotten there once in six attempts.The critics sharpened their vocal cords. Some blamed his game. Few wagged fingers at his fitness. Others faulted the facilities around him. By August this year, his ranking fell to a low of 593. All this, while his first round opponent at the 2014 Chennai Open, 22-year old Pablo Carreno Busta, moved astonishingly from a ranking of 700 something to 64th in the last 12 months.On Tuesday, Bhambri and Busta, boys who had crossed each other in opposite directions on the ladder, met. Dealing with those sniggering voices must not have been easy, but the Indian stepped it up on Chennai's show court to bridge the gap.A straight sets win (6-4, 6-3) in the first round of an ATP 250 event may not be much, but for Bhambri it was one step taken on a long and arduous journey ahead. At Nungambakkam on New Year's eve, Bhambri showed that he had the game and the tenacity to walk the remainder of that journey, with a strong and clinical performance.... contd.
Pakistan took an early advantage after fast bowlers Junaid Khan and debutant Bilawal Bhatti bowled out Sri Lanka for 204 on Tuesday on the opening day of the first Test. Captain Angelo Mathews launched a counterattack by hitting 91 off 147 balls with 15 fours to give the total some respectability before he was the last man to be dismissed.Pakistan was 46-1 at stumps with debutant Ahmed Shehzad unbeaten on 25 as Khurram Manzoor was run out in the last over. Khan (5-58) had his fourth five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka while Bhatti (3-65) made an impressive debut by claiming three wickets in eight balls after lunch, which started a dramatic collapse as Sri Lanka lost seven wickets for just 57 runs.Bhatti had Mahela Jaywardene (5) caught behind and Khan got the vital wicket of prolific run-scorer Kumar Sangakkara (16) and Sri Lanka's experienced batsmen surely looked rusty from their nine-month break of test matches since last competing against Bangladesh in March.It was Pakistan, who looked to have lost the plot after captain Misbah-ul-Haq won the toss on a greenish wicket of Sheikh Zayed Stadium when Dimuth Karunaratne (38) and Kaushal Perera (20) provided a solid start of 57 runs.Karunaratne was quick to punish any overpitched delivery and Sri Lanka scored a brisk 50 runs in the first hour off fast bowlers Khan, Bhatti and Rahat Ali.Karunaratne hit five fours before Asad Shafiq took a brilliant catch off Khan to remove him but Sri Lanka still managed to have a decent start of 66-1 by lunch. Pakistan also lost one of its two television referrals when they thought Khan had found the outside edge of Perera's bat on 18, but TV umpire Sundaram Ravi upheld the not out decision.In a stunning turnaround after lunch, Bhatti ignited the collapse when he had Perera (20), Mahela Jayawardene (5) and Dinesh Chandimal (0) dismissed in eight balls and Khan wrecked the lower middle order.... contd.
